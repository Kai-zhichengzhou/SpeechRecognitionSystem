sample-021002,this is for the boy
sample-021003,there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
sample-021004,our bitch had puppies do you want one
sample-021005,well then we've got a problem
sample-021006,this is from the governor
sample-021007,but he appeared to be unaware of any danger
sample-021010,but that left me without any honest means of support
sample-021011,you're in luck you two the fat arab said
sample-021012,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
sample-021013,the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
sample-021014,the sheep had taught him that
sample-021015,the old man looked disappointed
sample-021016,he really was a king a wise king
sample-021017,but my heart is agitated the boy said
sample-021028,the hookahs were extinguished and the guards stood at attention
sample-021029,and he hadn't perceived them because he had become accustomed to them
sample-021038,he'll drive you batty
sample-021039,what are they wearing now
sample-021040,i found myself alone and saw the people on the other side of the pit running away
sample-021041,tell them all to wait
sample-021042,he remembered the sword
sample-021043,at other times at a crucial moment i make it easier for things to happen
sample-021044,i have to separate out the sulfur
sample-021045,the oasis is neutral ground
sample-021046,i told him that was what i had come here to learn
sample-021047,he could sell the stones and buy a return ticket
sample-021048,what's she talking about
sample-021049,maybe i could sell tickets
sample-021050,the boy had never even noticed that there was a hole in his pouch
sample-021051,the two men hurried back and found the cylinder still lying in the same position
sample-021052,then suddenly he noticed it with a start
sample-021053,the rocking motion was nauseating
sample-021054,i locked eyes with a fish in the tank
sample-021055,i don't much like change he said
sample-021056,they were his treasure
sample-021057,look out where you're pointing that gun
sample-021058,i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
sample-021059,a little lemongrass should freshen it up
sample-021060,men dream more about coming home than about leaving the boy said
sample-021061,the boy looked around for the ovens and other apparatus used in alchemy but saw none
sample-021062,the sheep had taught him that
sample-021063,most cars have air conditioning these days
sample-021064,the boy prodded them one by one with his crook calling each by name
sample-021065,i would have won the junior olympics if not for those medaling kids
sample-021066,the boy offered his bottle hoping that the old man would leave him alone
sample-021067,there's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around
sample-021068,i'm surprised you didn't run into her
sample-021069,then came the night of the first falling star
sample-021070,down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
sample-021071,the crowd swayed a little as i elbowed my way through
sample-021072,but you don't know about love
sample-021073,you know i would
sample-021074,anywhere to get away from that wrangling
sample-021075,my chinchilla eats bread
sample-021076,as he looked at the stones he felt relieved for some reason
sample-021077,there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
sample-021078,we always observe the tradition
sample-021079,you're doing a great job so far
sample-021080,sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
sample-021081,i guess i've seen everything now
sample-021082,he moved about invisible but everyone could hear him
sample-021083,don't argue with me here
sample-021084,you guys wanna play some more poker
sample-021085,the thought was so dreadful to him that he forgot about the heat and went forward
sample-021086,i pointed out mars a bright dot of light
sample-021087,i have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk which was embedded in the ground
sample-021088,he must be disguised to avoid encounters with thieves
sample-021089,i saw astonishment and horror on the faces of the people around me
sample-021090,if you start your emails with greetings let me be the first to welcome you to earth
sample-021091,if you can concentrate always on the present you'll be a happy man
sample-021092,i'm never more aware of a room's acoustics than when i'm trying to enjoy a snack i have no intention of sharing
sample-021093,they were looking only for gold his companion answered
sample-021094,they begin creeping up on you trying to sell you something
sample-021095,you will never reopen
sample-021096,sit down and let me treat you to something said the boy
sample-021097,now where was that hat
sample-021098,for every ten dead men among our enemies you will receive a piece of gold
sample-021099,you already know about alchemy
sample-021100,some of the grey ash was falling off the circular edge
sample-021101,it's true life really is generous to those who pursue their destiny the boy thought
sample-021102,people saw me coming and welcomed me he thought
sample-021103,it was faintly marked with transverse stripes and slightly flattened from the perfect round
sample-021104,i'd like to build a display case for the crystal the boy said to the merchant
sample-021105,one of my best reporters
sample-021106,the salesman was like the rest of them untrustworthy
sample-021107,the phone rang while she was awake
sample-021108,in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
sample-021109,let me formulate a response to that question
sample-021110,the closer he got to the realization of his dream the more difficult things became
sample-021111,there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
sample-021112,in his hand he grasped a snake by the tail
sample-021113,how could you even think that
sample-021114,this is for the boy
sample-021115,he felt uneasy at the man's presence
sample-021116,among these people were a couple of cyclists a gardener i employed sometimes and a girl carrying a baby
sample-021117,the man preferred basil over parsley
sample-021118,the car however was not damaged
sample-021119,the tin was made from aluminium
sample-021120,give honor girl zero of  stars
sample-021121,nothing personal in it
sample-021122,i want to see him do it said the chief
sample-021123,after all he had all his money
sample-021124,they were fascinating stories each of them lived out his destiny to the end
sample-021125,the boy had never even noticed that there was a hole in his pouch
sample-021126,but there they saw a crystal shop that offered refreshing mint tea
sample-021127,let's meet tomorrow
sample-021128,because you have already lost your savings twice
sample-021129,once to the thief and once to the general
sample-021130,i'm a desert woman and i'm proud of that
sample-021131,but the boy sat down and waited
sample-021132,joanne ought to be back by now
sample-021133,his seat was unstable
sample-021134,it was dropping off in flakes and raining down on the sand
sample-021135,you wanna take this outside
sample-021136,about eleven i walked back to my home in maybury because nothing seemed to be happening
sample-021137,that man is terrific
sample-021138,it drew a droplet of blood
sample-021139,when he had completed the cleaning he asked the man for something to eat
sample-021148,vibrations of peace throughout the tent
sample-021149,the accommodation was affordable and cosy
sample-021158,a large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered
sample-021159,our merchants bought that man and brought him to egypt
sample-021160,he suddenly felt tremendously happy
sample-021161,i just don't trust anyone who says they've never had hamburger helper
sample-021162,now i too will be one of the women who wait
sample-021163,your eyes show the strength of your soul answered the alchemist
sample-021164,second with a keyboard you can hold a movement key and release when you reach your location
sample-021165,he believed in omens
sample-021166,try it again
sample-021167,why was it that he wanted the boy to serve as his instrument
sample-021170,scattered groups of people were hurrying from the direction of woking
sample-021171,however the authors ignore a very large body of work on tone mapping
sample-021172,without responding the guard entered the tent where he remained for some time
sample-021173,you should see the other guy specifically how good at fighting he is
sample-021174,he transformed himself into a stone that rolled up to the miner's foot
sample-021175,but there they saw a crystal shop that offered refreshing mint tea
sample-021176,most meteorites are more or less rounded
sample-021177,the fluid sprayed across the foyer
sample-021188,but that's why you created the game in the first place the boy answered
sample-021189,the levanter increased in intensity
sample-021198,thanks for dropping around
sample-021199,by the light of their own destruction i saw them staggering and falling and their supporters turning to run
sample-021200,the children were almost tyrannical
sample-021201,it was a very warm october
sample-021202,brent's opening attack on the governor
sample-021203,but men began to reject simple things and to write tracts interpretations and philosophical studies
sample-021204,naturally we have to do something about it
sample-021205,all this happened between sunrise and sunset the boy thought
sample-021206,he wanted to forget about the vision and return to his meditation
sample-021207,an old man with a breastplate of gold wouldn't have lied just to acquire six sheep
sample-021210,from here on you will be alone the alchemist said
sample-021211,you have enough gold to buy many sheep and many camels
sample-021212,i want my husband to wander as free as the wind that shapes the dunes
sample-021213,you do all the hiring around here
sample-021214,yeah its definitely worth checking out especially if the pay is reasonable and the work is good for your career
sample-021215,in any case it's good that you've learned that everything in life has its price
sample-021216,everything in life is an omen said the englishman now closing the journal he was reading
sample-021217,lindsey promised to call you from new york tonight
sample-021228,when he reached the top of the dune his heart leapt
sample-021229,you're a big help
sample-021238,but they were not there
sample-021239,my review of the sun one star
sample-021241,then he dropped his spade picked up his jacket and came out into the road
sample-021242,the englishman asked if they were in danger
sample-021243,if something isn't done
sample-021244,the boy was getting irritated
sample-021245,the drivers carried the freight themselves over such treacherous footing and then reloaded the camels
sample-021246,this kettle is quicker at boiling water than the old one
sample-021247,we'll have something to drink and eat these hawks
sample-021248,and you've told me nothing along the way said the boy
sample-021249,the boy didn't know what a person's destiny was
sample-021250,suddenly he disappeared and i could hear a faint shriek behind the walls
sample-021251,wait until it happens to you sometime
sample-021252,it must have fallen while i was sitting over there
sample-021253,the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
sample-021255,the tractor was bearing down hard
sample-021256,thanks ever so much for the bag
sample-021257,he looked like an arab which was not unusual in those parts
sample-021258,because he was terrified the boy didn't answer
sample-021259,i didn't do anything
sample-021260,its lower end was still embedded
sample-021261,they ate in silence
sample-021262,so how will we name all these hurricanes
sample-021263,he left without saying goodbye to the crystal merchant
sample-021264,almost everyone here speaks spanish
sample-021265,all they think about is food and water
sample-021266,he needed someone to talk to so as to avoid thinking about the possibility of war
sample-021267,this isn't for me to decide
sample-021268,these families have children
sample-021269,a friend of yours
sample-021270,it would have been visible to me had i only looked up as it passed
sample-021271,well then why do we need all these books the boy asked
sample-021272,i imagine this will be a surprise to some people
sample-021273,but don't let him interrupt you
sample-021274,the snake slithered toward the shaded boulders under the cliff
sample-021275,they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
sample-021276,my review of the sun one star
sample-021277,the boy awoke as the sun rose
sample-021278,in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
sample-021279,what kind of a proof is that
sample-021280,i want my husband to wander as free as the wind that shapes the dunes
sample-021281,my mind ran on the possibilities of its content
sample-021282,curse the moment i met that old man he thought
sample-021284,but the englishman was exultant
sample-021285,from where i am the sun said i can see the soul of the world
sample-021286,the guy thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to stop him
sample-021287,then suddenly he noticed it with a start
sample-021288,there was a small building there with a window at which people bought tickets to africa
sample-021289,one of my best reporters
sample-021290,they're not my children
sample-021291,he lives at the alfayoum oasis his friend had said
sample-021292,she refilled her vessel and left
sample-021293,the englishman prodded him and the boy asked her about the man who cured people's illnesses
sample-021294,down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
sample-021295,happy to know you
sample-021296,they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
sample-021298,he got up early with the idea of finding it
sample-021299,he didn't need to demonstrate his science and art to anyone
sample-021300,so it's better to listen to what it has to say
sample-021301,they're forming clubs
sample-021302,don't say that again
sample-021303,but the englishman was exultant
sample-021304,they're not my sheep anymore he said to himself without nostalgia
sample-021305,of course this usually requires access to the application source code or at least an extension
sample-021306,it is up there
sample-021307,henderson went into the railway station to telegraph the news to london
sample-021308,looking at the sun he calculated that he would reach tarifa before midday
sample-021309,because my eyes are not yet accustomed to the desert the boy said
sample-021310,handle that with kid gloves
sample-021311,and so despite the fact that he was a roman centurion he converted to their faith
sample-021312,so what should i do now the boy asked
sample-021313,air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
sample-021314,think about that
sample-021315,dusk was falling as the boy arrived with his herd at an abandoned church
sample-021316,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
sample-021317,we'll have some lunch and you can tell me everything
sample-021318,for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
sample-021319,they formed heaps that are visible a mile and a half away
sample-021320,listen to your heart
sample-021321,they don't see that the fields are new and the seasons change
sample-021322,the englishman had been profoundly impressed by the story
sample-021323,they mounted their horses and rode out in the direction of the pyramids of egypt
sample-021324,a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder
sample-021325,there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
sample-021326,throughout the night the boy dug at the place he had chosen but found nothing
sample-021327,he had never imagined that questions about life would be of such importance to a shepherd
sample-021328,the heat lasted until nightfall and all that time he had to carry his jacket
sample-021329,the door was locked
sample-021330,but the tradition also says that we should believe the messages of the desert
sample-021331,i'm a desert woman and i'm proud of that
sample-021332,parachuting is dangerous
sample-021333,i still have no idea how to turn myself into the wind the boy repeated
sample-021334,you know you did
sample-021335,but you could bring them in here
sample-021336,have you ever seen a spaghetti tree
sample-021337,they might even have become friends but the englishman closed off the conversation
sample-021338,and one or two persons were returning
sample-021339,you can't begin to spend all the money you've got
sample-021348,the fool flew all the way up here in a blizzard
sample-021349,he had never even wept in front of his own sheep
sample-021358,the beach looked so beautifully
sample-021359,its observation probabilities are computed as a product of pixel probabilities
sample-021360,it dribbled down the fridge
sample-021361,these families have children
sample-021362,and look how many things the wind already knew how to do
sample-021363,well then we've got a problem
sample-021364,it was glaringly hot not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind
sample-021365,the snake fought frantically making hissing sounds that shattered the silence of the desert
sample-021366,of course i believe you
sample-021367,the boy repeated his question
sample-021370,more good luck telegrams
sample-021371,he looked like an arab which was not unusual in those parts
sample-021372,this wedge prevents the trailer from rolling down the slope in case of brake failure
sample-021373,what's going on here
sample-021374,it's true that everything has its destiny but one day that destiny will be realized
sample-021375,he should respect tradition
sample-021376,that's not true the boy said
sample-021377,i don't know where to go
sample-021388,he seemed unfriendly and had looked irritated when the boy had entered
sample-021389,i dont know how comfortable it would be for a person
sample-021398,down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
sample-021399,will you come here
sample-021400,'m all about those invisible cosmic connections that transcend time and distance
sample-021401,judge debra sent me
sample-021402,he's looking for you
sample-021403,three armed tribesmen approached and asked what the boy and the alchemist were doing there
sample-021404,on the seventh day the alchemist decided to make camp earlier than usual
sample-021405,where she used to live
sample-021406,there is no wine in this country the young man said
sample-021407,aesthetically speaking it was ugly
sample-021410,he didn't need to seek out the old woman for this
sample-021411,turning the air conditioning on leads to an increased fuel consumption
sample-021412,when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
sample-021413,if you start your emails with greetings let me be the first to welcome you to earth
sample-021414,then he dropped his spade picked up his jacket and came out into the road
sample-021415,meanwhile the boy thought about his treasure
sample-021416,i'm not going to charge you anything now she said
sample-021417,several figures approached him
sample-021428,it's the master work of the alchemists
sample-021429,i'm hunting with my falcon the alchemist answered
sample-021438,the book that most interested the boy told the stories of the famous alchemists
sample-021439,it's called the principle of favorability
sample-021440,and he asked the boy if he too were in search of the alchemist
sample-021441,the englishman didn't answer him directly
sample-021442,most of them were staring quietly at the big table
sample-021443,the boy picked up his pouch and put it with his other things
sample-021444,he was going to miss the place and all the good things he had learned
sample-021445,the boy trusted his new friend
sample-021446,survival of the casualties stays our top priority
sample-021447,this convention's gonna cost plenty
sample-021448,and now it was only four days before he would be back in that same village
sample-021449,why not right here
sample-021450,the englishman was disappointed
sample-021451,rate stars in my pocket like grains of sand  out of  points
sample-021452,he was immensely excited at the news
sample-021453,the alchemist stopped abruptly and bent to the ground
sample-021454,it's true that everything has its destiny but one day that destiny will be realized
sample-021455,gives you an idea of the season
sample-021456,what's that other paper going to give you
sample-021457,you're losing your eye
sample-021458,it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience
sample-021459,don't you like her
sample-021460,but none of that is from the pyramids said the alchemist
sample-021461,you don't have to wait till january
sample-021462,'and this is what your son said' the angel told the man
sample-021463,and so will you
sample-021464,some men were smoking from a gigantic pipe that they passed from one to the other
sample-021465,i need it to get to the pyramids he said
sample-021466,help me the boy said
sample-021467,ruth spoke out of turn
sample-021468,something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top
sample-021469,the horizon was tinged with red and suddenly the sun appeared
sample-021470,he prepared himself a sandwich and drank some hot tea from a crystal glass
sample-021471,this morning i found a calculator taped to my wii
sample-021472,but the marketplace was empty and he was far from home so he wept
sample-021473,many telescopes were pointed at it
sample-021474,as they sat down at the only table in the place the crystal merchant laughed
sample-021475,how could he be a fake
sample-021476,the boy was also saddened his friend was in pursuit of his destiny
sample-021477,and he gave the boy his blessing
sample-021478,and the girl pointed to the south indicating that it was there the strange man lived
sample-021479,let's dance
sample-021480,the boy promised himself that when he returned from egypt he would buy that sword
sample-021481,the thought was so dreadful to him that he forgot about the heat and went forward
sample-021482,light up with the street with johnson
sample-021483,this cup is made of polystyrene
sample-021484,i want to know what it is
sample-021485,i'm trying to explain to my mother how to get pictures off her phone
sample-021486,there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
sample-021487,the system with certificate authorities has some serious issues
sample-021488,it was a pleasant change from talking to his sheep
sample-021489,with all of it
sample-021490,will i learn to do that someday the boy asked
sample-021491,well then why do we need all these books the boy asked
sample-021492,all who went there were happy at having done so
sample-021493,the lawyer successfully defended his client
sample-021494,the next day he gave his son a pouch that held three ancient spanish gold coins
sample-021495,the miner had abandoned everything to go mining for emeralds
sample-021496,you should see the other guy specifically how good at fighting he is
sample-021497,is there anything wrong
sample-021498,i've been nominated for membership in the national geographic society
sample-021499,had our instruments permitted it we might have been able to see the trouble way back when
sample-021500,it brought his heart into his mouth
sample-021501,i'm trying to explain to my mother how to get pictures off her phone
sample-021502,i shall make us some ice cubes
sample-021503,the only meaningful results are currently in table 
sample-021504,i didn't know shepherds knew how to read said a girl's voice behind him
sample-021505,it was more activity than usual for this time of the morning
sample-021506,every day was there to be lived or to mark one's departure from this world
sample-021507,it was glaringly hot not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind
sample-021508,give me my robe
sample-021509,what's the matter with eleanor
sample-021510,i want to tell you a story about dreams said the alchemist
sample-021511,you know i didn't tell anybody i was coming here
sample-021512,we lit the lantern and walked over to his house
sample-021513,people saw me coming and welcomed me he thought
sample-021514,i'm never more aware of a room's acoustics than when i'm trying to enjoy a snack i have no intention of sharing
sample-021515,the door was locked
sample-021516,he put his headcloth in place and secured it with a ring made of camel skin
sample-021517,it must have fallen while i was sitting over there
sample-021518,people say strange things the boy thought
sample-021519,he expertly gutted the rabbit
sample-021520,when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
sample-021521,as soon as he saw me among the crowd he called to me to come down
sample-021522,don't try to enter into the life of the oasis
sample-021523,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
sample-021524,it's like the flight of those two hawks it can't be understood by reason alone
sample-021525,worked hard just to have food and water like the sheep
sample-021527,i was wondering if you would work on this project with me because i cant find anyone else
sample-021528,from the railway station in the distance came the sound of trains ringing and rumbling
sample-021529,it was better than the scent of the hookahs
sample-021530,i found it out a little late
sample-021531,he was more certain of it than of anything in the world
sample-021533,and above all don't forget to follow your destiny through to its conclusion
sample-021534,how about a little service
sample-021535,they were his treasure
sample-021536,the caravan would be very lucky to reach the oasis
sample-021537,i asked him to let me use the kitchen for a while the alchemist smiled
sample-021538,it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience
sample-021539,he was so ashamed that he wanted to cry
sample-021548,it must have fallen while i was sitting over there
sample-021549,he moved about invisible but everyone could hear him
sample-021558,what is a foreigner doing here asked another of the men
sample-021559,something terribly important's happened
sample-021560,i'm interested only in the present
sample-021561,the tradition teaches men how to cross the desert and how their children should marry
sample-021562,here's some cigars the boss sent up
sample-021563,except for my ulcers
sample-021564,i need four hundred and fifty dollars in counterfeit money
sample-021565,it was starlight and i explained the signs of the zodiac to her
sample-021566,the company's stock value increased dramatically after they found a new medicine
sample-021567,just things like that
sample-021570,somebody should eat the mango i guess it is me
sample-021571,i locked eyes with a fish in the tank
sample-021572,he said he couldn't have handled it better himself
sample-021573,it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-021574,it frightened the deer scaring her into the road
sample-021575,the boy wanted to believe that his friend had simply become separated from him by accident
sample-021576,if you can concentrate always on the present you'll be a happy man
sample-021577,we need to solve this problem fast
sample-021588,i shall make us some ice cubes
sample-021589,the boy was getting irritated
sample-021598,but i found it difficult to get to work because of the investigations
sample-021599,did you speak to mr norton
sample-021600,i got two giant bug bites on my right leg from last night and they hurt
sample-021601,don't say that again
sample-021602,go down to the office and arrange for some radio time
sample-021603,many of them had been right about what they said while some had been wrong
sample-021604,they reminded him of the old man
sample-021605,my mind ran on the possibilities of its content
sample-021606,some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound
sample-021607,the boy approached her to ask about the alchemist
sample-021610,the boy was relieved
sample-021611,the boy repeated his question
sample-021612,never heard of such a thing
sample-021613,a card hanging in the doorway announced that several languages were spoken in the shop
sample-021614,criminals cry for it
sample-021615,the camel driver though seemed not to be very concerned with the threat of war
sample-021616,i told you baldwin was in trouble
sample-021617,is there a mrs joshua
sample-021628,a monk dressed in black came to the gates
sample-021629,this was my destiny not yours the alchemist answered
sample-021638,i'm going to them
sample-021639,he's pretty young for that job
sample-021640,no hope no adventure no old kings or destinies no treasure and no pyramids
sample-021641,it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
sample-021642,do you think your boyfriend is cheating on you
sample-021643,the next thing the dope wants is a room
sample-021644,it was as if the world had fallen silent because the boy's soul had
sample-021645,that's true enough the boy thought ruefully
sample-021646,all this happened between sunrise and sunset the boy thought
sample-021647,yes its disorganized but it will still happen
sample-021648,i'll just watch him he said to himself
sample-021649,but maybe i'll never have another chance to get to the pyramids in egypt
sample-021650,the boy climbed the dune slowly
sample-021651,there was a general movement backwards
sample-021652,they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
sample-021653,he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
sample-021654,that's why i feel that i deserve a part of what you find
sample-021655,i locked eyes with a fish in the tank
sample-021656,yesterday i waited forever for the subway train
sample-021657,two more months passed and the shelf brought many customers into the crystal shop
sample-021658,even coming down on the train together she wrote me
sample-021659,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
sample-021660,he moved about invisible but everyone could hear him
sample-021661,our mortgage is in arrears
sample-021662,am i going to find my treasure he asked
sample-021663,he hoped that it would be someone as capable as his previous apprentice
sample-021664,but it is not a class that was requested by our alumni or prospective students
sample-021665,they crossed the desert for another two days in silence
sample-021666,so you know about love the boy said
sample-021667,it's not so bad
sample-021668,i can clean up those glasses in the window if you want said the boy
sample-021669,what is love the desert asked
sample-021670,you don't call this a convenience
sample-021671,we took all the chances
sample-021672,we've existed since time began
sample-021673,then came a war
sample-021674,better abort it before you get tangled up
sample-021675,diesel is the cheapest one because of lower taxes
sample-021676,at the highest point in tarifa there is an old fort built by the moors
sample-021677,well what good would it be to you if you had t die the alchemist answered
sample-021678,most of them were staring quietly at the big table
sample-021679,i can see that
sample-021680,and better still to be alone with one's books
sample-021681,the picnic was ruined by a marching band
sample-021682,who'd you say it was
sample-021683,the first baseman dropped the ball
sample-021684,among these people were a couple of cyclists a gardener i employed sometimes and a girl carrying a baby
sample-021685,i didn't come here to have you read my palm he said already regretting having come
sample-021686,just step on it
sample-021687,i believe what she said
sample-021688,to do that successfully i must have no fear of failure
sample-021689,i don't know how to find life in the desert the boy said
sample-021690,it seems old and wise
sample-021691,he could always go back to being a shepherd
sample-021692,the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
sample-021693,be careful with your prognostications said the stranger
sample-021694,now you got me
sample-021695,he knelt down to find urim and thummim and put them back in the pouch
sample-021696,that's a lot of hooey
sample-021697,before the boy could reply a butterfly appeared and fluttered between him and the old man
sample-021698,the boy and the englishman had bought camels and climbed uncertainly onto their backs
sample-021699,he told fatima that at their next meeting
sample-021700,a lot of patience but shepherds know all about patience
sample-021701,did you write that letter to miss mitchell
sample-021702,the boy trusted his new friend
sample-021703,he remembered something his grandfather had once told him that butterflies were a good omen
sample-021704,continue in the direction of the pyramids said the alchemist
sample-021705,i just don't trust anyone who says they've never had hamburger helper
sample-021706,they ate in silence
sample-021707,he didn't know the man yet but his practiced eye would recognize him when he appeared
sample-021708,then suddenly he noticed it with a start
sample-021709,how come you speak spanish he asked
sample-021710,what does that get us
sample-021711,i shall make us some ice cubes
sample-021712,it has happened many times before
sample-021713,the genies were the spirits of good and evil
sample-021714,the englishman was disappointed
sample-021715,it was a juggernaut
sample-021716,there are so many things to learn
sample-021717,but before i go i want to tell you a little story
sample-021718,a large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered
sample-021719,all the joy he had seen that morning had suddenly disappeared
sample-021720,take that food out of your mouth
sample-021721,nearby was the englishman reading a book
sample-021722,alfayoum is in egypt said the arab
sample-021723,for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
sample-021724,they were racing down the streets with no regard for anyone
sample-021725,before the boy could reply a butterfly appeared and fluttered between him and the old man
sample-021726,i never saw that car before in my whole life
sample-021727,we miss you and miss having a friend like you and i am so happy that you two got to catch up
sample-021728,you dont compare directly to existing stateoftheart methods
sample-021729,so that those who have the responsibility for understanding can understand he said
sample-021730,now i will drift gently off to dreamland
sample-021731,as he was leaving he saw in the corner of the room his old shepherd's pouch
sample-021732,don't try to enter into the life of the oasis
sample-021733,he had always believed that the sheep were able to understand what he said
sample-021734,everyone seemed very excited
sample-021735,when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
sample-021736,when he emerged it was with a young arab dressed in white and gold
sample-021737,if he abandons that pursuit it's because it wasn't truelove
sample-021738,the old man gave a signal and everyone stood
sample-021739,the old man gave a signal and everyone stood
sample-021748,he wasn't asking for help
sample-021749,how strange africa is thought the boy
sample-021758,i get thirty dollars a week
sample-021759,melchizedek watched a small ship that was plowing its way out of the port
sample-021760,how do people celebrate good weather over there
sample-021761,just step on it
sample-021762,it was as if the world had fallen silent because the boy's soul had
sample-021763,the high humidity is making me sweat
sample-021764,the englishman asked if they were in danger
sample-021765,always heed the omens the old king had said
sample-021766,it seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of here
sample-021767,he got up early with the idea of finding it
sample-021770,i'm sending james over to see you
sample-021771,then how do i know this is your office
sample-021772,looking at the sun he calculated that he would reach tarifa before midday
sample-021773,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
sample-021774,i didn't want the publicity
sample-021775,the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
sample-021776,not everyone can see his dreams come true in the same way
sample-021777,but if you can try to make your own decisions
sample-021788,when he emerged it was with a young arab dressed in white and gold
sample-021789,i finally went by myself and came back this morning feeling happy and refreshed
sample-021798,i'm playing for keeps
sample-021799,we lit the lantern and walked over to his house
sample-021808,don't you want me to stay
sample-021809,but there's a tribal war the boy reiterated
sample-021818,replace the ts in tim tebow's name with any other consonant to get a star wars character
sample-021819,but i'm going to egypt the boy said
sample-021820,do i look as funny as you do
sample-021821,can't you give me another hour
sample-021822,why didn't you ask neal about it
sample-021823,i burned the omelette
sample-021824,from where i am the sun said i can see the soul of the world
sample-021825,i'm trying to explain to my mother how to get pictures off her phone
sample-021826,what does she look like
sample-021827,it's extremely suspicious that there's no information about brains that didn't come from a brain
sample-021830,don't be impatient he repeated to himself
sample-021831,for some reason we were blocked from entering
sample-021832,and seizing the boy's bag the alchemist gave the gold coins to the chief
sample-021833,only a few meters away there is a bus station
sample-021834,to show you one of life's simple lessons the alchemist answered
sample-021835,he should have decided to become a shepherd the boy said
sample-021836,thats because i want to remove the old grout from the bathroom tile
sample-021837,who are these people
sample-021840,james watt didn't invent the steam engine but he improved it significantly
sample-021841,i want to see him do it said the chief
sample-021842,when i first reached through to it i thought the soul of the world was perfect
sample-021843,one that will write
sample-021844,then he sat in the sunfilled doorway smoking the hookah
sample-021845,it's true that everything has its destiny but one day that destiny will be realized
sample-021846,the reason for this is to discern your strengths
sample-021847,we'll have some lunch and you can tell me everything
sample-021848,no the alchemist answered
sample-021849,to show you one of life's simple lessons the alchemist answered
sample-021850,he understands the forces of nature
sample-021851,what else are you
sample-021852,now it will be with hope
sample-021853,i don't know why
sample-021854,the boy preferred wine
sample-021855,it was more activity than usual for this time of the morning
sample-021856,they're just a pile of stones
sample-021857,he had seen the shooting star and was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere nearby
sample-021858,keep trying hard
sample-021859,his tshirt was drenched in sweat
sample-021860,well usually i learn more from my sheep than from books he answered
sample-021861,he was just and good
sample-021862,where do you live
sample-021863,there isn't any more wine
sample-021864,he was more confident in himself though and felt as though he could conquer the world
sample-021865,looking up he saw a pair of hawks flying high in the sky
sample-021866,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
sample-021867,it is all right
sample-021868,the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
sample-021869,the boy looked around him at the date palms
sample-021870,the war continued and at times the wind carried the sweet sickly smell of blood
sample-021871,he remembered the sword
sample-021872,and a little charge of kidnapping i'm looking into
sample-021873,he paid for the wool and asked the shepherd to come back the following year
sample-021874,he didn't know the man yet but his practiced eye would recognize him when he appeared
sample-021875,good luck to you
sample-021876,i'm an alchemist simply because i'm an alchemist he said as he prepared the meal
sample-021877,the python wasn't a snake it was a programming language
sample-021878,that's big of you
sample-021879,i don't know what she's talking about
sample-021880,and at that i told him and he took my place
sample-021881,it was the levanter the wind that came from africa
sample-021882,as the englishman left fatima arrived and filled her vessel with water
sample-021883,i read only what the birds wanted to tell me
sample-021884,you should see the other guy specifically how good at fighting he is
sample-021885,they're not concerned with that right now
sample-021886,you can't stop for a thing now
sample-021887,then you taught me something of the universal language and the soul of the world
sample-021888,about eleven i walked back to my home in maybury because nothing seemed to be happening
sample-021889,and if you improve on the present what comes later will also be better
sample-021890,it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
sample-021891,a breeze began to blow
sample-021892,i'll dig up that five thousand somehow
sample-021893,where do you live
sample-021894,as he did so he talked with the monk about the tribal wars
sample-021895,i didn't need to waste my time just for this he said
sample-021896,ann is very much interested
sample-021897,if you want something you gotta go get it
sample-021898,what a reception they got
sample-021899,there was no need to imprison them the arabs simply confiscated their horses
sample-021900,don't give in to your fears said the alchemist in a strangely gentle voice
sample-021901,the crowd swayed a little as i elbowed my way through
sample-021902,the tide rushed into the estuary at a menacing pace
sample-021903,you have enough gold to buy many sheep and many camels
sample-021904,but that was simply because my eye was tired
sample-021905,can we talk tomorrow
sample-021906,that's true enough the boy thought ruefully
sample-021907,he told fatima that at their next meeting
sample-021908,but they've got nothing to do with this case
sample-021909,it means my job
sample-021910,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
sample-021911,i'm going to scream
sample-021912,there's that reprieve if they ever find out
sample-021913,they were people of the desert and clamored to hear his stories about the great cities
sample-021914,which one is mine
sample-021915,maybe the church with the sycamore growing from within had been haunted
sample-021916,the boss level is easy
sample-021917,a predator drone equipped with multiple cruise missiles lifted off
sample-021918,a mink coat and a diamond bracelet
sample-021919,the sun burned mercilessly from the sky
sample-021920,advancing slowly they searched among the stones
sample-021921,he had to spit some tobacco out of his mouth
sample-021922,the usage of high information content is meaningless
sample-021923,nearby was the englishman reading a book
sample-021924,the boy fell to his knees and wept
sample-021925,i could have helped her
sample-021926,he sat looking at the sky for a long time
sample-021927,they walked together through the narrow streets of tangier
sample-021928,ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
sample-021929,they wanted to save the oasis
sample-021930,i'm never more aware of a room's acoustics than when i'm trying to enjoy a snack i have no intention of sharing
sample-021931,he had never imagined that questions about life would be of such importance to a shepherd
sample-021932,there was a murmur from the crowd
sample-021933,what's that book you've got there
sample-021934,the sword didn't fall
sample-021935,welli don't quite know what to say
sample-021936,it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
sample-021937,the alchemists spent years in their laboratories observing the fire that purified the metals
sample-021938,that doesn't happen to just anyone
sample-021939,now let's take a look at the candidates
sample-021940,that night there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet
sample-021941,it brought his heart into his mouth
sample-021942,i want my husband to wander as free as the wind that shapes the dunes
sample-021943,who is omar and what did he do
sample-021944,it was the devil
sample-021945,i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
sample-021946,one night the father had a dream
sample-021947,the top of the cylinder was rotating on its body
sample-021950,but you know that i'm not going to go to mecca
sample-021951,we can't leave greg here
sample-021952,one of them reminded me of her so i messaged the artist and bought it for her
sample-021953,that's why i keep losing
sample-021954,let me comb your hair
sample-021955,the boy went to look for the englishman
sample-021956,the newspaper articles had prepared everyone for the reception of the idea
sample-021957,this building has an elevator which is necessary for wheelchairs
sample-021968,and the girl pointed to the south indicating that it was there the strange man lived
sample-021969,he took out his money and counted it
sample-021978,it would have been visible to me had i only looked up as it passed
sample-021979,i used to live near el cairum he said
sample-021980,these are the spies said one of the men
sample-021981,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
sample-021982,i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
sample-021983,the night was warm and i was thirsty
sample-021984,she spun towards john and shouted look out
sample-021985,it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-021986,people are going off relief
sample-021987,you already know about alchemy
sample-021990,we returned to the cemetery
sample-021991,the caravans had been stopped at giza for some time waiting for the wars to end
sample-021992,the boy saw a man appear behind the counter
sample-021993,he started to read the book he had bought
sample-021994,he had seen the shooting star and was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere nearby
sample-021995,i would put it up there
sample-021996,where are you from the boy asked
sample-021997,bless you
sample-022000,better bring me a glass of milk
sample-022001,and here's fifty dollars on account
sample-022002,he put his headcloth in place and secured it with a ring made of camel skin
sample-022003,wait for the signal
sample-022004,let's go and have some lunch said the crystal merchant
sample-022005,he had always believed that the sheep were able to understand what he said
sample-022006,the caterpillar responded with a nod
sample-022007,he never asked me to sit down in his life
sample-022008,it's easy and yet i've never done it before he thought
sample-022009,the idea frightened him
sample-022010,maybe the church with the sycamore growing from within had been haunted
sample-022011,which view would you like
sample-022012,wasting my time listening to this mad hatter
sample-022014,this box of markers has many different colors
sample-022015,don't you know there are nine jobs waiting for this guy
sample-022016,the lift was operated by a pneumatic system
sample-022017,what was all that
sample-022018,all the joy he had seen that morning had suddenly disappeared
sample-022019,only the lights in the great tent remained
sample-022020,they'll be here any minute
sample-022021,remember that wherever your heart is there you will find your treasure
sample-022022,when i returned to the common the sun was setting
sample-022023,he said he couldn't have handled it better himself
sample-022024,he almost began to tell about his treasure but decided not to do so
sample-022025,it was more activity than usual for this time of the morning
sample-022026,he wants to get jill started in the research business
sample-022027,you don't have to be rich skinny popular or even own a cape to perform a random act of kindness
sample-022028,why do they need gin
sample-022029,you could have died after peace had been declared
sample-022030,this is for the boy
sample-022031,it was starlight and i explained the signs of the zodiac to her
sample-022032,you brought a new feeling into my crystal shop
sample-022033,do you know what cia stands for
sample-022034,it must have fallen while i was sitting over there
sample-022035,i had the everyone has gary busey's teeth dream again
sample-022036,sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
sample-022037,in those days very few of the people had any idea about astronomy
sample-022038,i'll always let you down
sample-022039,she said linda did it
sample-022040,camels are traitorous they walk thousands of paces and never seem to tire
sample-022041,that's good thought the englishman
sample-022042,then taking his sheep he walked away
sample-022043,i wonder if ernie's still here with his taxicab
sample-022044,it was a fighter jet flying between the buildings
sample-022045,it was our money and we want it back
sample-022046,don't forget that everything you deal with is only one thing and nothing else
sample-022047,i don't even know who i'm talking to any more
sample-022050,it seemed such a little thing so bright and small and still
sample-022051,they locked themselves in their laboratories and tried to evolve as gold had
sample-022052,you're looking for witch doctors he spoke some verses from the koran and moved on
sample-022053,he fell asleep and when he awoke the sun was already high
sample-022054,this is christmas eve
sample-022055,arabs often appeared in the city shopping and chanting their strange prayers several times a day
sample-022056,i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
sample-022057,i'm a woman of the desert she said averting her face
sample-022068,that sobered him a little
sample-022069,if he abandons that pursuit it's because it wasn't truelove
sample-022078,it's the other foreigner the englishman
sample-022079,they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
sample-022080,you must understand that love never keeps a man from pursuing his destiny
sample-022081,when he speaks in our language i can interpret what he has said
sample-022082,it brought his heart into his mouth
sample-022083,i'm going into business for myself
sample-022084,i know its dimensions and how it behaves
sample-022085,and your camels will bring you wealth and power
sample-022086,there the alchemist separated the disk into four parts
sample-022087,he spent the entire morning observing the infrequent comings and goings in the street
sample-022090,what does that get us
sample-022091,go to this address
sample-022092,something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top
sample-022093,this pepperoni tastes off she said
sample-022094,they placed the symbols of the pilgrimage on the doors of their houses
sample-022095,my review of the sun one star
sample-022096,the boy approached her to ask about the alchemist
sample-022097,and i will be the policeman
sample-022108,all that time the martians must have been getting ready
sample-022109,because i've always heard about them the boy answered saying nothing about his dream
sample-022118,the englishman had been profoundly impressed by the story
sample-022119,the crowd on the far left seemed to get bigger and i heard now a faint murmur from it
sample-022120,a large piece suddenly came off and fell with a loud and sharp noise
sample-022121,there the alchemist separated the disk into four parts
sample-022122,we heard a lot of yelling
sample-022123,i dare her to move that desk out of here
sample-022124,in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
sample-022125,i'm going away he said
sample-022126,the old man looked disappointed
sample-022127,he didn't want any conversation at this point
sample-022130,love is the falcon's flight over your sands
sample-022131,there were really i think two or three hundred people elbowing one another
sample-022132,he had seen the shooting star and was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere nearby
sample-022133,strange images passed through my mind
sample-022134,three armed tribesmen approached and asked what the boy and the alchemist were doing there
sample-022135,it's gonna put our city on the map
sample-022136,now it will be with hope
sample-022137,i'm not afraid of anything
sample-022140,some went away while i was there and other people came
sample-022141,i'll take mine now
sample-022142,the freeway was nearly deserted so they cruised effortlessly to their exit
sample-022143,i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
sample-022144,i'm doing much better and soon you'll be able to return to your sheep
sample-022145,he noticed the unequal cooling of its surface
sample-022146,if you start your emails with greetings let me be the first to welcome you to earth
sample-022147,play some concerto from t s monk
sample-022148,the boy smiled to himself
sample-022149,he didn't need to demonstrate his science and art to anyone
sample-022150,in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
sample-022151,it was as if the world had fallen silent because the boy's soul had
sample-022152,dense clouds of smoke or dust can be seen through a powerful telescope
sample-022153,the boy promised himself that when he returned from egypt he would buy that sword
sample-022154,it was only words
sample-022155,because my eyes are not yet accustomed to the desert the boy said
sample-022156,that might be all right
sample-022157,on the very first page it described a burial ceremony
sample-022158,i want to see him do it said the chief
sample-022159,next morning there were two thousand armed men scattered throughout the palm trees at al fayoum
sample-022160,and of course it's not very customizable
sample-022161,you could have married anybody else in town
sample-022162,he noticed the unequal cooling of its surface
sample-022163,and at that i told him and he took my place
sample-022164,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
sample-022165,i saw him get it
sample-022166,the invaders carried the name everywhere the beautiful girl spoke of the invaders with pride
sample-022167,my seven year resume gap is marked not drugs
sample-022168,something bright reflected from his chest with such intensity that the boy was momentarily blinded
sample-022169,the boy watched as his companion went to his horse and withdrew a scimitar
sample-022170,revenge is not my style but obviously accidents will happen
sample-022171,that night there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet
sample-022172,what's the matter with everybody
sample-022173,her jeans have holes in them
sample-022174,we were all made by the same hand and we have the same soul
sample-022175,do you know that i threw it away
sample-022176,how does slacker robbie feel about that
sample-022177,but he knew that salem wasn't in andalusia
sample-022178,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
sample-022179,well then why do we need all these books the boy asked
sample-022180,it was a tent like many at the oasis
sample-022181,you can't believe it's not butter
sample-022182,but the boy never took his eye off his new friend
sample-022183,strong passwords don't have to be hard to remember
sample-022184,for a moment everything was dark and scary
sample-022185,the swimming pool was full of chlorine
sample-022186,you shouldn't be here the alchemist answered
sample-022187,have you seen him
sample-022188,i have the money i need to buy my sheep
sample-022189,maktub the boy said remembering the crystal merchant
sample-022190,and one can always come back
sample-022191,from the railway station in the distance came the sound of trains ringing and rumbling
sample-022192,i'm going to guide you across the desert the alchemist said
sample-022193,i saw him get it
sample-022194,i failed to reach a conclusive interpretation
sample-022195,but she said nothing
sample-022196,the shop is exactly the size i always wanted it to be
sample-022197,we couldn't find the high street
sample-022198,the newspaper articles had prepared everyone for the reception of the idea
sample-022199,i pointed out mars a bright dot of light
sample-022200,she just stepped out
sample-022201,when i returned to the common the sun was setting
sample-022202,but now i'm sad and alone
sample-022203,i don't know if i'll be able to find life in the desert the boy thought
sample-022204,but horses tire bit by bit
sample-022205,how do you expect me to get any work done
sample-022206,i can't think of any reason why she was killed
sample-022207,let me comb your hair
sample-022208,what would i have to say
sample-022209,the same hand that had brandished the sword now held a whip
sample-022210,i was frightened by a presence in my house that whispered terrible things
sample-022211,help me the boy said
sample-022212,it would have been visible to me had i only looked up as it passed
sample-022213,hires two personal trainers and make one of them train the other one
sample-022214,they provided warnings about thieves and barbarian tribes
sample-022215,get martin out of jail
sample-022216,and then he perceived it very slowly
sample-022217,the oasis is neutral ground
sample-022218,i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit
sample-022219,i want to live again
sample-022220,where are we going to put him
sample-022221,well why did you say that i don't know about love the sun asked the boy
sample-022222,the dunes are changed by the wind but the desert never changes
sample-022223,he moved about invisible but everyone could hear him
sample-022224,they were surrounded by children curious to look at the animals and people that were arriving
sample-022225,and don't wear your high hat
sample-022226,as they sat down at the only table in the place the crystal merchant laughed
sample-022227,will you come here
sample-022228,they began to ride out over the sands with the moon lighting their way
sample-022229,the lightbulbs need changing again
sample-022230,i found myself alone and saw the people on the other side of the pit running away
sample-022231,i don't think it's very ethical reading other people's stuff
sample-022232,i'll work for you he said
sample-022233,from where i am the sun said i can see the soul of the world
sample-022234,you can't believe it's not butter
sample-022235,i'm going to them
sample-022236,in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
sample-022237,the boy was getting irritated
sample-022238,the old man said nothing
sample-022239,the secretary tugged at a loose fibre
sample-022240,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
sample-022241,i guess you're right
sample-022242,the man looked at him without responding
sample-022243,it brought his heart into his mouth
sample-022244,they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
sample-022245,i was impatient to see it opened
sample-022246,i just got rid of one crowd
sample-022247,his eyes filled with tears as he spoke of the prophet
sample-022250,in alchemy it's called the soul of the world
sample-022251,that sobered him a little
sample-022252,drawing from my own experience as a learner of english and german i value engaging activities that involve everyday conversation
sample-022253,how do you expect me to get any work done
sample-022254,he had surprised himself with the thought
sample-022255,most meteorites are more or less rounded
sample-022256,and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
sample-022257,even though the sheep didn't teach me to speak arabic
sample-022268,you'll watch them as they grow demonstrating how the world is always changing
sample-022269,my review of the sun one star
sample-022278,yet it was a little too large for assurance
sample-022279,now i too will be one of the women who wait
sample-022280,the boy thought it a strange question
sample-022281,learn to recognize omens and follow them the old king had said
sample-022282,then he dropped his spade picked up his jacket and came out into the road
sample-022283,i understand sheep they're no longer a problem and they can be good friends
sample-022284,the man was speaking the language of alchemy
sample-022285,but he still couldn't flee
sample-022286,all they ever do really is look for food and water
sample-022287,get the riot gear
sample-022290,and for wise men gold is the metal that evolved the furthest
sample-022291,this is what i wished for
sample-022292,before him was an enormous white horse rearing over him with a frightening scream
sample-022293,when he reached the top of the dune his heart leapt
sample-022294,i've had a dozen calls already
sample-022295,and don't bump into anything
sample-022296,you have a mania for simplifying everything answered the englishman irritated
sample-022297,not to worry said the alchemist
sample-022308,he has other things to do first
sample-022309,i really hope i can earn a badge for finishing the class
sample-022318,their horses cried out and all their weapons were filled with sand
sample-022319,my review of the sun one star
sample-022320,i have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk which was embedded in the ground
sample-022321,those gypsies are really smart he thought
sample-022322,because the crystal was dirty
sample-022323,it's called the principle of favorability
sample-022324,i don't want anything else in life
sample-022325,about eleven i walked back to my home in maybury because nothing seemed to be happening
sample-022326,a card hanging in the doorway announced that several languages were spoken in the shop
sample-022327,without responding the guard entered the tent where he remained for some time
sample-022330,we've got to get this desk out of here
sample-022331,she tied her shoelaces into a bow
sample-022332,replace the ts in tim tebow's name with any other consonant to get a star wars character
sample-022333,next morning there were two thousand armed men scattered throughout the palm trees at al fayoum
sample-022334,where's ashley's wallet
sample-022335,it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
sample-022336,the heather was on fire and you could see a thin blue smoke rising up slowly
sample-022337,i am definitely open to the idea because ive always wanted to work as a small business owner
sample-022340,he also tried to remember some good stories to relate as he sheared the sheep
sample-022341,because for him you are a green field from which he always returns with game
sample-022342,then he took from his knapsack a bottle of wine and drank some
sample-022343,i promised that i would make my own decisions he said to himself
sample-022344,is there a crowd in the street
sample-022345,i could die happily and that made me feel good
sample-022346,the strange horseman drew an enormous curved sword from a scabbard mounted on his saddle
sample-022347,he expertly gutted the rabbit
sample-022348,you don't have to be rich skinny popular or even own a cape to perform a random act of kindness
sample-022349,i came to tell you just one thing the boy said
sample-022350,who is your friend the chief asked
sample-022351,then the thing came upon him in a flash
sample-022352,because they're still here
sample-022353,one day the earth began to tremble and the nile overflowed its banks
sample-022354,you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
sample-022355,is that any good
sample-022356,i finally have enough money and all the time i need
sample-022357,you'd think i was on the witness stand
sample-022358,but maybe people who felt that way had never learned the universal language
sample-022359,fifty cents on the dollar
sample-022360,i want to stay at the oasis the boy answered
sample-022361,what had been next to him five minutes ago was now at the other side
sample-022362,it was a tent like many at the oasis
sample-022363,is that any good
sample-022364,i am father now can you believe it
sample-022365,don't say anything fatima interrupted
sample-022366,you're demanding your rights
sample-022367,i just want to dream about mecca
sample-022368,by tomorrow they'll be calling me bruce baldwin
sample-022369,among these people were a couple of cyclists a gardener i employed sometimes and a girl carrying a baby
sample-022370,your money saved us for three days
sample-022371,and better still to be alone with one's books
sample-022372,that makes sense the alchemist answered
sample-022373,so what should i do now the boy asked
sample-022374,the river babbled inanely to itself
sample-022375,i want to stay at the oasis the boy answered
sample-022376,i'm going to wait here for you every day
sample-022377,one by one the campfires were extinguished and the oasis fell as quiet as the desert
sample-022378,replace the ts in tim tebow's name with any other consonant to get a star wars character
sample-022379,she doesn't look happy
sample-022380,as if i had the money back in a safe
sample-022381,it's just like any other day as far as i'm concerned
sample-022382,but now the sounds inside had stopped
sample-022383,you already know all you need to know
sample-022384,how do people celebrate good weather over there
sample-022385,i never knew grandma to be so determined before
sample-022386,but there was a sixth day the sun went on
sample-022387,they can't use the jena doug clubs for politics
sample-022388,what do you know about it
sample-022389,you don't have to apologize
sample-022390,he wasn't an alchemist
sample-022391,i'm hunting with my falcon the alchemist answered
sample-022392,the boy thought it a strange question
sample-022393,but they don't count
sample-022394,an army is coming the boy said
sample-022395,what are they doing the old man asked pointing at the people in the plaza
sample-022396,not until the moon was high did the alchemist ride into view
sample-022397,i had it served with my breakfast this morning
sample-022398,but he still couldn't flee
sample-022399,absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
sample-022400,why don't you have your friends join us
sample-022401,the englishman's eyes lit up
sample-022402,they were surrounded by children curious to look at the animals and people that were arriving
sample-022403,i need you to be spontaneous he asked me out to din din
sample-022404,there was nothing to hold him back except himself
sample-022405,looking around he sought his sheep and then realized that he was in a new world
sample-022406,the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
sample-022407,and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
sample-022408,i knew you would come
sample-022409,he had suddenly remembered that in tarifa there was an old woman who interpreted dreams
sample-022410,it's not i the wind spoke about
sample-022411,one night the father had a dream
sample-022412,the top had certainly ceased to rotate
sample-022413,only the lights in the great tent remained
sample-022414,collateral of any kind
sample-022415,but i'm going in search of my treasure the boy said
sample-022416,there were really i think two or three hundred people elbowing one another
sample-022417,your father's had a stroke of luck
sample-022418,when i had my sheep i was happy and i made those around me happy
sample-022419,where are you bound asked the young arab
sample-022420,you have been a real blessing to me
sample-022421,none of this ha d made an impression on the boy
sample-022422,it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
sample-022423,camels are traitorous they walk thousands of paces and never seem to tire
sample-022424,the wind's curiosity was aroused something that had never happened before
sample-022425,people are going off relief
sample-022426,meanwhile the boy thought about his treasure
sample-022427,will i learn to do that someday the boy asked
sample-022428,the boy began again to read his book but he was no longer able to concentrate
sample-022429,trust in your heart but never forget that you're in the desert
sample-022430,but before i go i want to tell you a little story
sample-022431,the dunes are changed by the wind but the desert never changes
sample-022432,i've got to get started on my interview
sample-022433,well then why did you let me do it the boy asked
sample-022434,sorry the test period expired
sample-022435,i thought about whether we should find coins and models in it and so on
sample-022436,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
sample-022437,when he emerged it was with a young arab dressed in white and gold
sample-022438,it was only when i got this close to it that the strangeness of it was at all evident to me
sample-022439,it knew of the boy's talk with the desert because the winds know everything
sample-022440,this is for the boy
sample-022441,c'mon over and join our party
sample-022442,the boy was surprised
sample-022443,i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
sample-022444,her father's awful worried about her
sample-022445,that he had attended a seminary until he was sixteen
sample-022446,i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
sample-022447,hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after
sample-022450,that's the point at which most people give up
sample-022451,the two men hurried back and found the cylinder still lying in the same position
sample-022452,first he had studied esperanto then the world's religions and now it was alchemy
sample-022453,somebody pushed against me and i almost fell into the ditch
sample-022454,they'll believe him
sample-022455,he took urim and thummim from his pocket and began playing with them
sample-022456,the arab accepted them without a word
sample-022457,i'm a sucker for this country
sample-022468,this morning i found a calculator taped to my wii
sample-022469,revenge is not my style but obviously accidents will happen
sample-022478,you can't believe it's not butter
sample-022479,the merchant was silent for a few moments
sample-022480,and then he perceived it very slowly
sample-022481,you've forgotten my milk
sample-022482,some storms are worth the wreckage
sample-022483,the fumes from the traffic was unbearable
sample-022484,it was early morning when she woke up
sample-022485,what had been next to him five minutes ago was now at the other side
sample-022486,shall i announce you
sample-022487,like everybody learns he said
sample-022490,i know why i want to get back to my flock he thought
sample-022491,he paused for a moment to see if the woman knew what the egyptian pyramids were
sample-022492,two days ago you said that i had never dreamed of travel the merchant answered
sample-022493,dense clouds of smoke or dust can be seen through a powerful telescope
sample-022494,the other son was a poet and delighted all of rome with his beautiful verses
sample-022495,where'd you get this
sample-022496,please give me my robe
sample-022497,we don't know what's in the confounded thing do you
sample-022508,it seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of here
sample-022509,two days ago you said that i had never dreamed of travel the merchant answered
sample-022518,why would a king be talking with a shepherd the boy asked awed and embarrassed
sample-022519,why do you want to find that sort of person the arab asked
sample-022520,that's never happened to me the boy said
sample-022521,i don't like people to do that because the sheep are afraid of strangers
sample-022522,i looked outside the window and saw the basil
sample-022523,at once he connected the two incidents
sample-022524,he should respect tradition
sample-022525,then they got ahold of some dough and went goofy
sample-022526,i only interpret dreams
sample-022527,the strange horseman drew an enormous curved sword from a scabbard mounted on his saddle
sample-022530,sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
sample-022531,and ask for a glass of wine for me
sample-022532,the boy looked around for the ovens and other apparatus used in alchemy but saw none
sample-022533,that's a good amount to start with
sample-022534,another trick the boy thought
sample-022535,the valley was filled with dense fog
sample-022536,but now the sounds inside had stopped
sample-022537,i didn't want the publicity
sample-022540,when i returned to the common the sun was setting
sample-022541,maybe no one here knows what an alchemist is
sample-022542,there was no justification for it
sample-022543,as the sun rose the men began to beat the boy
sample-022544,you must always know what it is that you want the old king had said
sample-022545,henderson went into the railway station to telegraph the news to london
sample-022546,when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
sample-022547,something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top
sample-022548,hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after
sample-022549,i accuse this man of being a faker
sample-022550,he could always become a crystal salesman again
sample-022551,don't give us that ethics stuff
sample-022552,are you going to believe every lie he tells you
sample-022553,that makes sense the alchemist answered
sample-022554,what does she look like

sample-022567,so what is salem like he asked trying to get some sort of clue
sample-022568,show me some gratitude
sample-022569,that's the way it always is said the old man
sample-022570,your eyes show the strength of your soul answered the alchemist

sample-022685,when the blinding dust had settled a bit the boy trembled at what he saw
sample-022686,it was the devil
sample-022687,but i found it difficult to get to work because of the investigations
sample-022690,they blow across the world without a birthplace and with no place to die
sample-022691,some of the grey ash was falling off the circular edge
sample-022692,the heather was on fire and you could see a thin blue smoke rising up slowly
sample-022693,the same is true for animals

sample-022718,what a lovely day
sample-022719,you and i were the only ones that kept our heads
sample-022720,i don't blame him
sample-022721,an army is coming the boy said
sample-022722,they were relieved and happy
sample-022723,a lot of patience but shepherds know all about patience
sample-022724,the volume wouldn't increase much further
sample-022725,the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
sample-022726,did you tell them that funny story you told me yesterday
sample-022727,nature knows me as the wisest being in creation the sun said

sample-022735,the wind began to pick up
sample-022736,no one paid any attention to the two travelers
sample-022737,that's the magic of omens said the boy
sample-022740,several figures approached him
sample-022741,they're not worth much the englishman answered
sample-022742,we're nearing the end of the beginning and that feels great
sample-022743,it seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of here
sample-022744,it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
sample-022745,it is all right
sample-022746,peter shrunk back aghast
sample-022747,but he takes advantage of you
sample-022748,the cistern was malfunctioning
sample-022750,it seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of here
sample-022751,i have the diet of a kid who found twenty dollars
sample-022752,'m all about those invisible cosmic connections that transcend time and distance
sample-022753,but he kept the sword in his hand
sample-022754,i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
sample-022755,i've stuck it back together
sample-022756,when he had completed the cleaning he asked the man for something to eat
sample-022757,and so despite the fact that he was a roman centurion he converted to their faith
sample-022758,then the thing came upon him in a flash
sample-022759,there must be somebody there
sample-022760,and then he perceived it very slowly
sample-022761,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
sample-022762,what did your family have to say about it
sample-022763,did you know there's a swimming pool under this floor
sample-022764,i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit
sample-022765,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
sample-022766,the boy knew and was now working toward it
sample-022767,how long since we've seen each other
sample-022768,it is i who dared to do so said the boy
sample-022769,when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
sample-022770,maybe the alchemist has never been in love the boy thought
sample-022771,i'm going to go back to doing just what i did before the boy thought
sample-022772,the problem is that they don't even realize that they're walking a new road every day
sample-022773,i want to get back to my sheep faster
sample-022774,night fell and an assortment of fighting men and merchants entered and exited the tent
sample-022776,look at it today
sample-022777,he knew how to shear them and how to slaughter them
sample-022778,down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
sample-022779,how about once more around the park
sample-022780,it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
sample-022781,evidently we're the floor show
sample-022782,i think somebody stole one of his crown jewels
sample-022783,the waitress was carrying an impressive amount of dinnerware but then an earthquake occurred and she dropped it all
sample-022784,but his heart was speaking of other things
sample-022785,they were given to me as a present by a king the boy said
sample-022786,he had understood the story the old king had told him
sample-022787,are you a real cowboy
sample-022788,there are a lot of powerful tools and libraries out there
sample-022789,the suspension bridge was swinging in the gale
sample-022790,where are you from the boy asked
sample-022791,this was the strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space
sample-022792,i'm going into business for myself
sample-022793,i'm the leader of the caravan said a darkeyed bearded man
sample-022794,we ignore the other parents who dont speak french
sample-022795,it was like electricity through her veins
sample-022796,on the second day the boy climbed to the top of a cliff near the camp
sample-022797,and their eyes spoke of death
sample-022798,then he dropped his spade picked up his jacket and came out into the road
sample-022799,the porcupine scurried home
sample-022800,he's mr big and mr small
sample-022801,its lower end was still embedded
sample-022802,they reached the center of a large plaza where the market was held
sample-022803,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
sample-022804,it turns out this is easier than you might expect
sample-022805,i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
sample-022806,it seemed so safe and tranquil
sample-022807,people saw me coming and welcomed me he thought
sample-022808,finally after hours of waiting the guard bade the boy enter
sample-022809,tell me more about your dream said the woman
sample-022810,we've got something between us nothing can change
sample-022811,are you all right
sample-022812,he had never imagined that questions about life would be of such importance to a shepherd
sample-022813,some people prefer not to quantify their feelings that way
sample-022814,the terrorist group made their demand
sample-022815,so what should i do now the boy asked
sample-022816,but you are forcing me to look at wealth and at horizons i have never known
sample-022817,there was a moment of silence so profound that it seemed the city was asleep
sample-022818,but bakers are more important people than shepherds
sample-022819,i'm never more aware of a room's acoustics than when i'm trying to enjoy a snack i have no intention of sharing
sample-022820,luckily there was a zebra crossing
sample-022821,it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
sample-022822,can i get a woot woot
sample-022823,one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
sample-022824,the old man said nothing
sample-022825,then he dropped his spade picked up his jacket and came out into the road
sample-022826,and that's where the power of love comes in
sample-022827,a large piece suddenly came off and fell with a loud and sharp noise
sample-022828,they provided warnings about thieves and barbarian tribes
sample-022829,say something else
sample-022830,where have you been
sample-022831,you get out of here quick
sample-022832,it commenced to blow harder raising the desert sands
sample-022833,don't be impatient he repeated to himself
sample-022834,andreas placed the shell against his ear so he could hear the ocean
sample-022835,can you do your stuff
sample-022836,two days ago you said that i had never dreamed of travel the merchant answered
sample-022837,i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit
sample-022838,but that's why you created the game in the first place the boy answered
sample-022839,suddenly the elder at the center smiled almost imperceptibly and the boy felt better
sample-022848,the lumberjack jumped up the tree
sample-022849,sure i know where she lives
sample-022858,on the very first page it described a burial ceremony
sample-022859,he ran his fingers slowly over the stones sensing their temperature and feeling their surfaces
sample-022860,and seizing the boy's bag the alchemist gave the gold coins to the chief
sample-022861,that sobered him a little
sample-022862,it's not my house
sample-022863,the boy was surprised at his thoughts
sample-022864,i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
sample-022865,are you sure there's no mistake
sample-022866,i can always go back to being a shepherd the boy thought
sample-022867,then came the night of the first falling star
sample-022870,throughout the night the boy dug at the place he had chosen but found nothing
sample-022871,i'm doing much better and soon you'll be able to return to your sheep
sample-022872,and one or two persons were returning
sample-022873,the alchemist removed the pan from the fire and set it aside to cool
sample-022874,the sheep will get used to my not being there too the boy thought
sample-022875,everything in life is an omen said the englishman now closing the journal he was reading
sample-022876,i'd like you to take me there if you can
sample-022877,some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound
sample-022888,they opened the bottle of wine and drank heavily
sample-022889,he got up early with the idea of finding it
sample-022898,he paused for a moment to see if the woman knew what the egyptian pyramids were
sample-022899,you guys better quit politics and take in washing
sample-022900,it was flowering beautifully
sample-022901,they're forming clubs
sample-022902,and don't pull that on me neither
sample-022903,henderson went into the railway station to telegraph the news to london
sample-022904,why the shots stopped after the tenth no one on earth has tried to explain
sample-022905,maybe this is an omen said the englishman half aloud
sample-022906,the crowd swayed a little as i elbowed my way through
sample-022907,there were just drawings coded instructions and obscure texts
sample-022910,some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound
sample-022911,he was already re accustomed to desert's silence
sample-022912,he told her about the morning's meeting
sample-022913,a boy came running towards me
sample-022914,learn to recognize omens and follow them the old king had said
sample-022915,the caravans had been stopped at giza for some time waiting for the wars to end
sample-022916,and their eyes spoke of death
sample-022917,give me some carrots and other vegetables i'm going to feed the rabbits
sample-022928,alchemy is a serious discipline
sample-022929,i need you to be spontaneous he asked me out to din din
sample-022938,everything in life is an omen said the englishman now closing the journal he was reading
sample-022939,the trouble with you is you let people step on you
sample-022940,important information might be missing
sample-022941,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
sample-022942,do you know what's wrong with you
sample-022943,the boy leapt as well but away from the alchemist
sample-022944,that's good thought the englishman
sample-022945,you know what i mean
sample-022947,says for us to go the limit
sample-022948,i didn't have it
sample-022949,it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
sample-022950,he recited an our father silently
sample-022951,on the seventh day the alchemist decided to make camp earlier than usual
sample-022953,his hands were abraded and exhausted but he listened to his heart
sample-022954,i hate to think what he'll say
sample-022955,he paid for the wool and asked the shepherd to come back the following year
sample-022956,a large piece suddenly came off and fell with a loud and sharp noise
sample-022957,i was just in town earlier this year so it is kind of crazy to think about what took place right after
sample-022958,you'd better take it easy
sample-022959,toffee coated all the surfaces it was disgustingly sticky
sample-022960,not everyone is able to read source code
sample-022961,shoot through the desk
sample-022962,why'd you want to save me
sample-022963,i can clean up those glasses in the window if you want said the boy
sample-022964,it's not often that money can save someone's life
sample-022965,there the alchemist separated the disk into four parts
sample-022966,this is mr zach carter
sample-022967,oh they're laughing at me
sample-022968,he had studied latin spanish and theology
sample-022969,and seizing the boy's bag the alchemist gave the gold coins to the chief
sample-022970,but they were not there
sample-022971,they were tribesmen dressed in blue with black rings surrounding their turbans
sample-022972,it was a pleasant change from talking to his sheep
sample-022973,every evening the dogs in our neighbourhood are howling
sample-022974,the little group of people from the city dispersed
sample-022975,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
sample-022976,it sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself
sample-022977,we've got to get bail
sample-022978,i have a problem with how you motivate the method
sample-022979,they didn't have the printing press in those days the boy argued
sample-022980,you'll use your knowledge for the welfare of the oasis and its inhabitants
sample-022981,love required them to stay with the people they loved
sample-022982,now what are you going to do
sample-022983,if i know where she is
sample-022984,and finally the falcon returned with their meal
sample-022986,how much was it again
sample-022987,this is the moment i have been waiting for
sample-022988,this can arouse national interest
sample-022989,i've never had one before the merchant answered
sample-022990,the old man wore a breastplate of heavy gold covered with precious stones
sample-022992,there was no trace of him
sample-022993,whenever he could he sought out a new road to travel
sample-022994,i'm trying to explain to my mother how to get pictures off her phone
sample-022995,the boy took them to the cliff where he had been on the previous day
sample-022996,many of our soldiers teamed up
sample-022997,i'll just go upstairs and send it over with a messenger
sample-022998,sometime during the second year you'll remember about the treasure
sample-022999,as they sat down at the only table in the place the crystal merchant laughed
sample-023000,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
sample-023001,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
sample-023002,it brought his heart into his mouth
sample-023003,there were really i think two or three hundred people elbowing one another
sample-023004,the shop is closed on mondays
sample-023005,but there was a sixth day the sun went on
sample-023006,suddenly the monster disappeared
sample-023007,the tribal chieftains will appreciate what you do
sample-023010,you couldn't even be honest about being dishonest
sample-023011,an huge hole had been made by the impact of the projectile
sample-023012,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
sample-023013,but children always seem to be able to play with them without frightening them
sample-023014,but he kept quiet because he had heard what the alchemist said to the monk
sample-023015,we'll find you a hotel
sample-023016,that's what it means
sample-023017,maybe she didn't even remember him
sample-023028,we've got to walk up to the tower
sample-023029,the boy took out urim and thummim from his bag
sample-023038,you can count on me under one condition
sample-023039,but men began to reject simple things and to write tracts interpretations and philosophical studies
sample-023040,do you want to go to work for me the merchant asked
sample-023041,they're not concerned with that right now
sample-023042,you can't believe it's not butter
sample-023043,there's no time like the present
sample-023044,and at that i told him and he took my place
sample-023045,the people were also praying to heaven for protection
sample-023046,what do you associate with iceland
sample-023047,the hookahs were extinguished and the guards stood at attention
sample-023048,we've been laughing all day about that
sample-023049,it would have been visible to me had i only looked up as it passed
sample-023050,maybe the church with the sycamore growing from within had been haunted
sample-023051,about an hour ago
sample-023052,i simply can't get it to gel
sample-023053,at once he connected the two incidents
sample-023054,he had tried in vain to establish a relationship with an alchemist
sample-023055,with the girl with the raven hair his days would never be the same again
sample-023056,she says she's gonna write fiction
sample-023057,he should respect tradition
sample-023058,life is beautiful
sample-023059,his life and his path had always provided him with enough omens
sample-023060,but one of them seized the boy and yanked him back out of the hole
sample-023061,the pixel probabilities are conditioned on the model state
sample-023062,elsa knitted furiously
sample-023063,i don't know who anybody is any more
sample-023064,looking through the telescope i saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet
sample-023065,he had seen the shooting star and was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere nearby
sample-023066,what is it you're looking for asked the old merchant
sample-023067,looking through the telescope i saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet
sample-023068,the merchant was silent for a few moments
sample-023069,no no thanks just looking
sample-023070,what do you mean it's okay
sample-023071,three armed tribesmen approached and asked what the boy and the alchemist were doing there
sample-023072,my tax dollars pay for those public school proms
sample-023073,i heard a faint movement under my feet
sample-023074,many of them had been right about what they said while some had been wrong
sample-023075,at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars
sample-023076,angela is pregnant she told me
sample-023077,i'll phone them right away to get that story
sample-023078,they might even have become friends but the englishman closed off the conversation
sample-023079,brenda peters just escaped from the county jail
sample-023080,why did we have to have all these kids
sample-023081,he told me i should try to do so
sample-023082,when he emerged it was with a young arab dressed in white and gold
sample-023083,he needed someone to talk to so as to avoid thinking about the possibility of war
sample-023084,symmetric algorithms tend to be faster than asymmetric ones
sample-023085,it was impossible to remember all the details that he covered in an hour
sample-023086,the idea frightened him
sample-023087,the driver got knocked cold
sample-023088,i don't like seals anyhow
sample-023089,but he didn't stop
sample-023090,what does she look like
sample-023091,i'm just a man who wanders the desert and knows the stars said the alchemist
sample-023092,as he did so he talked with the monk about the tribal wars
sample-023093,have you seen him
sample-023094,i don't want anything for myself
sample-023095,the night was warm and i was thirsty
sample-023096,i had the everyone has gary busey's teeth dream again
sample-023097,curse the moment i met that old man he thought
sample-023098,it seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of here
sample-023099,the sword didn't fall
sample-023100,i'm doing much better and soon you'll be able to return to your sheep
sample-023101,the sheep will get used to my not being there too the boy thought
sample-023102,the boy thought it a strange question
sample-023103,without questioning he said what the screen of his computer dictated to him
sample-023104,but you mustn't feel that way
sample-023105,the corset constricted her waist
sample-023106,prefetching is used to avoid cache misses
sample-023107,the boy's name was santiago
sample-023108,with the wars between the tribes it's impossible to cross the desert
sample-023109,what was the reason for the increase
sample-023110,learn to recognize omens and follow them the old king had said
sample-023111,is there a crowd in the street
sample-023112,a missing parrot is called a polygon
sample-023113,looking up he saw a pair of hawks flying high in the sky
sample-023114,maybe the alchemist has never been in love the boy thought
sample-023115,these are days of sacrifice
sample-023116,the two men hurried back and found the cylinder still lying in the same position
sample-023117,what are you doing there
sample-023118,i myself heard nothing of that
sample-023119,about eleven i walked back to my home in maybury because nothing seemed to be happening
sample-023120,the crowd gasped as they realised that the speaker was completely naked
sample-023121,i waited all afternoon and evening he said
sample-023122,this morning i found a calculator taped to my wii
sample-023123,the next day he gave his son a pouch that held three ancient spanish gold coins
sample-023124,that it was unable to deal with this boy who spoke the language of the world
sample-023125,the top of the cylinder was rotating on its body
sample-023126,turkey for thanksgiving
sample-023127,are you coming tomorrow
sample-023128,i got two giant bug bites on my right leg from last night and they hurt
sample-023129,maybe it was because they moved around so much
sample-023130,i give my hands a chance to heal from rsi repetitive strain injury on the weekends
sample-023131,i have been waiting for her to respond for two days now so i just went ahead and did it for her
sample-023132,then suddenly he noticed it with a start
sample-023133,the alchemist removed the pan from the fire and set it aside to cool
sample-023134,the area was swirling in dust so intense that it hid the moon from view
sample-023135,scattered groups of people were hurrying from the direction of woking
sample-023136,cause you know how politicians are
sample-023137,the president heroically fought against such savagery
sample-023138,the boy wanted to believe that his friend had simply become separated from him by accident
sample-023139,gmo are ruining our crops
sample-023148,you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
sample-023149,and he looked out over the desert that had brought him to the woman he loved
sample-023158,have you no idea who could have done it
sample-023159,his grandfather was a snake
sample-023160,they went in to drink the tea which was served in beautiful crystal glasses
sample-023161,who are these people
sample-023162,by the light of their own destruction i saw them staggering and falling and their supporters turning to run
sample-023163,you've got to be at work in the morning
sample-023164,suddenly the elder at the center smiled almost imperceptibly and the boy felt better
sample-023165,the men at the bar were obviously drunk
sample-023166,i say we don't go out any more
sample-023167,men have never understood the words of the wise
sample-023170,when he's an old man he's going to spend a month in africa
sample-023171,how do you stop this thing
sample-023172,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
sample-023173,afraid it might rain
sample-023174,three to two in our favor
sample-023175,i just want to dream about mecca
sample-023176,and at that i told him and he took my place
sample-023177,your money saved us for three days
sample-023188,he stood irresolute for a moment and then scrambled out of the pit
sample-023189,the two men exchanged some words in arabic and the bar owner seemed irritated
sample-023198,but none of that mattered to the alchemist
sample-023199,i want to do something big and something important
sample-023200,we lit the lantern and walked over to his house
sample-023201,they went in to drink the tea which was served in beautiful crystal glasses
sample-023202,astronomy might be complicated but it's not rocket science
sample-023203,you can get around very easily by train  which is a very relaxing and affordable way to travel
sample-023204,this sentence does not make any sense
sample-023205,you have helped me the man continued to prepare his tea saying nothing
sample-023206,i had the everyone has gary busey's teeth dream again
sample-023207,why you lied to me
sample-023210,he brings her own lunch to work and eats by himself at his desk
sample-023211,but then he stopped
sample-023212,i sold crystal and crossed the desert
sample-023213,you'll get your money in sixty days
sample-023214,i want to get back to my sheep faster
sample-023215,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
sample-023216,we'll carry the desk over
sample-023217,the boy noticed that the man's clothing was strange
sample-023228,he needs three days answered the alchemist
sample-023229,don't ask me why i don't know why
sample-023238,and he wasn't faring much better
sample-023239,hello kitty is actually a girl not a cat
sample-023240,somebody call the police
sample-023241,we could get to the pyramids by tomorrow said the other taking the money
sample-023242,and he wasn't faring much better
sample-023243,that's the principle that governs all things he said
sample-023244,how are you
sample-023245,we're just travelers the alchemist answered
sample-023246,the alchemist knocked on the gate of the monastery
sample-023247,it seemed so safe and tranquil
sample-023248,as soon as he saw me among the crowd he called to me to come down
sample-023249,'everyone loved them and enjoyed them
sample-023250,who'd you say it was
sample-023251,it was difficult not to think about what he had left behind
sample-023252,the boy remembered an old proverb from his country
sample-023253,he was immensely excited at the news
sample-023254,people are going off relief
sample-023255,something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top
sample-023256,not until the moon was high did the alchemist ride into view
sample-023257,no one attacks an oasis
sample-023258,and he wasn't faring much better
sample-023259,you were here on my wedding night
sample-023260,remember what happened to lisa
sample-023261,yeah its definitely worth checking out especially if the pay is reasonable and the work is good for your career
sample-023262,you've passed me on the street almost every day
sample-023263,they were known as seers and they were held in fear by women and the elderly
sample-023264,looking through the telescope i saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet
sample-023265,we speak of them only to children
sample-023266,you were seen at the enemy camp three days ago
sample-023267,the boy closed his book
sample-023268,the merchant was silent for a few moments
sample-023269,of course the two were unable to do anything
sample-023270,he moved about invisible but everyone could hear him
sample-023271,replace the ts in tim tebow's name with any other consonant to get a star wars character
sample-023272,i had never heard of alchemists before the boy said
sample-023273,the peak of this mountain is over two thousand meters above sea level
sample-023274,the same is true for animals
sample-023275,i had to act quickly that's why i jumped in
sample-023276,there was nothing to hold him back except himself
sample-023277,it seems old and wise
sample-023278,ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
sample-023279,when i returned to the common the sun was setting
sample-023280,the sheep had taught him that
sample-023281,she'll be all right
sample-023282,the one we pick has gotta be the typical average person
sample-023283,the nearby city of ceuta had grown faster than tangier and business had fallen off
sample-023284,the boy didn't know what to say
sample-023285,but maybe i'll never have another chance to get to the pyramids in egypt
sample-023286,i am in search of that universal language among other things
sample-023287,and now it was only four days before he would be back in that same village
sample-023288,the issue can be avoided entirely
sample-023289,i can only tell you what i saw
sample-023290,roger the backup team is on the way
sample-023291,it's a sacrifice we all ought to be glad to make
sample-023292,you had me worried
sample-023293,watching the parody was great entertainment
sample-023294,there was very little talking
sample-023295,heehaw and merry christmas
sample-023296,then the thing came upon him in a flash
sample-023297,the shop was busy and the man asked the shepherd to wait until the afternoon
sample-023298,i have had the same dream twice he said
sample-023299,the boy was startled
sample-023300,no that's not what i mean
sample-023301,please bring mama back
sample-023302,he could see that the old man wanted to know more about his life
sample-023303,the two were taken to a nearby military camp
sample-023304,are you sure that joe case is going on next week
sample-023305,everyone seemed very excited
sample-023306,it was as if carl realised that he was a puppet under someone else's control
sample-023307,aren't you allowed to kiss back
sample-023308,i'm through listening to you
sample-023309,it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
sample-023310,marty helped capture the remagen bridge
sample-023311,do you like cooking
sample-023312,i'm addicted to recycling
sample-023313,she wasn't her type
sample-023314,but they really don't know what they're saying
sample-023315,it was there that the wise man lived
sample-023316,the whole police force standing on it's ear
sample-023317,i guess i'm just upset about all this
sample-023318,in his hand he grasped a snake by the tail
sample-023319,when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
sample-023320,he waited patiently for the merchant to awaken and open the shop
sample-023321,the article introduces a very fast small and shallow feedforward network which is trained endtoend
sample-023322,i learned that at my grandma's knee
sample-023323,as he was attempting to pull out the rocks he encountered he heard footsteps
sample-023324,i'm not going very far the alchemist answered looking straight into the eyes of the horsemen
sample-023326,at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars
sample-023327,love is the force that transforms and improves the soul of the world
sample-023328,i was scared but wasted no time in going out and crossing the bridge to the sand pits
sample-023329,just get me home
sample-023330,go through with what
sample-023332,who is this man
sample-023333,mr nelson come yet
sample-023334,they rode for the entire day
sample-023335,you mustn't let what she said bother you
sample-023336,i want you to be my wife
sample-023337,the boy climbed the dune slowly
sample-023338,but this'll teach them a lesson
sample-023339,it is all right
sample-023348,stove's hotter than i thought
sample-023349,it was better than the scent of the hookahs
sample-023358,many of whom are homeless and hungry
sample-023359,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
sample-023360,every file had the letter a printed on the front
sample-023361,the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
sample-023362,i don't know if i'll be able to find life in the desert the boy thought
sample-023363,at the first glance it was really not very exciting
sample-023364,as the englishman left fatima arrived and filled her vessel with water
sample-023365,he had helped him out in a dangerous situation
sample-023366,it can be overwhelming to learn how to put all the pieces together
sample-023367,you'll watch them as they grow demonstrating how the world is always changing
sample-023370,yet it was a little too large for assurance
sample-023371,i am following my destiny
sample-023372,but i'm going in search of my treasure the boy said
sample-023373,go and speak to the tribal chieftains said the camel driver
sample-023374,then one day the boy returned the books to the englishman
sample-023375,am i going to find my treasure he asked
sample-023376,i'm proud of you
sample-023377,they might even have become friends but the englishman closed off the conversation
sample-023388,join the club
sample-023389,but you will love her and she'll return your love
sample-023398,because you will never again be able to keep it quiet
sample-023399,most meteorites are more or less rounded
sample-023400,i'm not talking about his grandfather's pet poodle
sample-023401,you have been a real blessing to me
sample-023402,you're not paid to be a canary
sample-023403,she looks so gorgeous today
sample-023404,sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
sample-023405,he was already re accustomed to desert's silence
sample-023406,and it goes for you too
sample-023407,and that he a boy could perform miracles
sample-023410,men dream more about coming home than about leaving the boy said
sample-023411,just by looking at them
sample-023412,i know why i want to get back to my flock he thought
sample-023413,the jacket had a purpose and so did the boy
sample-023414,she just stepped out
sample-023415,that's the way it always is said the old man
sample-023416,the alchemist stopped abruptly and bent to the ground
sample-023417,the guy thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to stop him
sample-023428,there was surely a baker in her town
sample-023429,that's the philosopher's stone and the elixir of life
sample-023438,this is for the boy
sample-023439,fatima the girl said averting her eyes
sample-023440,you can have as many babies as you like
sample-023441,what had been next to him five minutes ago was now at the other side
sample-023442,she and heather were talking
sample-023444,i don't want mrs douglas
sample-023445,take her to the hospital
sample-023446,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
sample-023447,the townsfolk were all chumps
sample-023448,the carpet was exquisite
sample-023449,they represent millions of voters
sample-023450,i tell you that it's no good
sample-023451,well then why do we need all these books the boy asked
sample-023452,there were raised voicesand some sort of struggle appeared to be going on 
sample-023453,down at the office we get all the help we want
sample-023454,the alchemist was a bit daunting but as the boy drank the wine he relaxed
sample-023455,the freeway was nearly deserted so they cruised effortlessly to their exit
sample-023456,there's something funny going on around here
sample-023458,an huge hole had been made by the impact of the projectile
sample-023459,don't mind the colonel
sample-023460,they'll never close us up today
sample-023461,and also by unhappiness envy and jealousy
sample-023462,can you hear me
sample-023463,the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
sample-023464,he was twenty minutes from his tent and began to make his way there
sample-023465,a card hanging in the doorway announced that several languages were spoken in the shop
sample-023466,and now an amanda derek convention
sample-023467,a breeze began to blow
sample-023468,he got up early with the idea of finding it
sample-023469,sunburns can be avoided by applying sunscreen or by staying in the shadows
sample-023470,i like gentle people
sample-023471,some went away while i was there and other people came
sample-023472,but most important he was able every day to live out his dream
sample-023473,who is it from
sample-023474,there was no way for everybody to know about alchemy
sample-023475,the streamer of gas came out towards us
sample-023476,the old man looked disappointed
sample-023477,i had never heard of alchemists before the boy said
sample-023478,i have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk which was embedded in the ground
sample-023479,he had used the two stones only once one morning when he was at a marketplace
sample-023481,the wind screamed with delight and blew harder than ever
sample-023482,the boy remembered an old proverb from his country
sample-023483,if you pay attention to the present you can improve upon it
sample-023484,but if you can try to make your own decisions
sample-023485,i'm also going back to paris today
sample-023486,can i have one of those
sample-023487,got to get some practice
sample-023488,everyone is just standing by the building waiting to get in
sample-023489,it is i who dared to do so said the boy
sample-023490,no hope no adventure no old kings or destinies no treasure and no pyramids
sample-023491,goodbye said the boy
sample-023492,doug's a good friend of mine
sample-023493,the boy was shaking with fear but the alchemist helped him out of the tent
sample-023495,the boy thought about the crystal merchant
sample-023496,and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
sample-023497,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
sample-023498,the young arab took out a book and began to read
sample-023499,fatima appeared at the entrance to the tent
sample-023500,what day is it
sample-023501,at the highest point in tarifa there is an old fort built by the moors
sample-023502,we've done it said the englishman who had also awakened early
sample-023503,the meeting was over
sample-023504,i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
sample-023505,doughnuts are best with strawberry sprinkles and coffee
sample-023506,my job requires a lot of travelling
sample-023507,now leave us alone said the boy to the young arab
sample-023508,some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound
sample-023509,but now i'm sad and alone
sample-023510,my greatgrandfather planted this tree
sample-023511,he couldn't have been wrong
sample-023512,my wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red green and yellow signal lights
sample-023513,you've got about two minutes
sample-023514,but that was simply because my eye was tired
sample-023515,it is still a phenomenal movement
sample-023516,the boy was relieved
sample-023517,and your camels will bring you wealth and power
sample-023518,it seems old and wise
sample-023519,his hands were abraded and exhausted but he listened to his heart
sample-023520,she's the best parkour runner i know
sample-023521,i was wondering if you could tell me a bit more about what it's like to live and work there
sample-023522,then he took from his knapsack a bottle of wine and drank some
sample-023523,and i'm sorry to say that the congestion is increasing
sample-023524,do you read me
sample-023525,what's the matter
sample-023526,you should see the other guy specifically how good at fighting he is
sample-023527,from there he could see africa in the distance
sample-023528,i'm going to hate those who have found their treasure because i never found mine
sample-023529,we're going to shoot the works
sample-023530,the boy was embarrassed and confessed that he had observed nothing
sample-023531,at the first glance it was really not very exciting
sample-023532,i'm coming fatima he said
sample-023533,what's the matter with you two guys
sample-023534,and if you improve on the present what comes later will also be better
sample-023535,among these people were a couple of cyclists a gardener i employed sometimes and a girl carrying a baby
sample-023536,they spoke about mercury salt dragons and kings and he didn't understand any of it
sample-023537,sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
sample-023538,a boy came running towards me
sample-023539,i shall make us some ice cubes
sample-023548,the brass lamp had been disturbed
sample-023549,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
sample-023558,he wrapped the twigs in a piece of cloth and put them back in his bag
sample-023559,how about that check
sample-023560,if you can concentrate always on the present you'll be a happy man
sample-023561,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
sample-023562,it's true that everything has its destiny but one day that destiny will be realized
sample-023563,they eat lunch together often but dont really talk outside the office
sample-023564,you've got everything all set
sample-023565,the men climbed the hill and they were tired when they reached the top
sample-023566,i have no information about troops or about the movement of the tribes
sample-023567,many people in berkshire surrey and middlesex must have seen it
sample-023570,it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
sample-023571,one afternoon they passed by the encampment of one of the tribes
sample-023572,hires two personal trainers and make one of them train the other one
sample-023573,alison couldn't help but feel pride in her creation
sample-023574,the boy had never even noticed that there was a hole in his pouch
sample-023575,what good is money to you if you're going to die
sample-023576,dusk was falling as the boy arrived with his herd at an abandoned church
sample-023577,i am definitely open to the idea because ive always wanted to work as a small business owner
sample-023588,maybe the church with the sycamore growing from within had been haunted
sample-023589,the boy's name was santiago
sample-023598,it was just ripe enough to eat
sample-023599,i'm still having trouble with baking
sample-023600,i need one more
sample-023601,the same hand that had brandished the sword now held a whip
sample-023602,henderson went into the railway station to telegraph the news to london
sample-023603,he had used the two stones only once one morning when he was at a marketplace
sample-023604,we sharpened our wits at university so we could handle this crisis
sample-023605,this isn't for me to decide
sample-023606,improving the public transport system would help avoid traffic jams
sample-023607,their horses cried out and all their weapons were filled with sand
sample-023610,we lit the lantern and walked over to his house
sample-023611,we'll pay all your expenses
sample-023612,i'll bring the kids in the car
sample-023613,but i found it difficult to get to work because of the investigations
sample-023614,the alchemist followed as the boy's horse ran for almost half an hour
sample-023615,we want some action in these pictures
sample-023616,i wished i had a light to smoke by
sample-023617,if you start your emails with greetings let me be the first to welcome you to earth
sample-023628,the camel driver was not a fighter and he had consulted with seers
sample-023629,something terrible's happened to me
sample-023638,sometimes i appear in the form of a solution or a good idea
sample-023639,the end of the cylinder was still as ogilvy and henderson had left it
sample-023640,we don't know what's in the confounded thing do you
sample-023641,many of them had been right about what they said while some had been wrong
sample-023642,she diluted the broth with chicken stock
sample-023643,christmas eve at midnight
sample-023644,he looked around at the empty plaza again feeling less desperate than before
sample-023645,tell nathan to get on the extension
sample-023646,it infuriates me and i don't know why
sample-023647,a boy came running towards me
sample-023648,help me find them
sample-023649,look around some time
sample-023650,he lives at the alfayoum oasis his friend had said
sample-023651,she doesn't know it yet
sample-023652,there is a universal language understood by everybody but already forgotten
sample-023653,he should have decided to become a shepherd the boy said
sample-023654,and she already has her treasure it's you
sample-023655,but now the sounds inside had stopped
sample-023656,thanks for the clarification
sample-023657,i'm already used to the way things are
sample-023658,he felt weighted down by the centuries of time since the pyramids had been built
sample-023659,and he immediately felt peace in his heart
sample-023660,you're not going anywhere
sample-023661,something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top
sample-023662,the alchemist rode in front with the falcon on his shoulder
sample-023663,that saved his life
sample-023664,they shouted consolation and promises and went off back to the town again to get help
sample-023665,how could he be a fake
sample-023666,yet it was a little too large for assurance
sample-023667,i promised that i would make my own decisions he said to himself
sample-023668,one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
sample-023669,there was nothing to hold him back except himself
sample-023670,but the englishman appeared not to attach any importance to it
sample-023671,this is why alchemy exists the boy said
sample-023672,bert the cop was wounded in north africa
sample-023673,a quarter of a million dollars
sample-023674,maybe she didn't even remember him
sample-023675,i've stuck it back together
sample-023676,i'm not going to charge you anything now she said
sample-023677,what's that book you've got there
sample-023678,it took some time for him to fully wake up
sample-023679,perhaps she forgot all about it
sample-023680,they ate in silence
sample-023681,what were you when you came here five years ago
sample-023682,henderson was taking it in
sample-023683,but he kept the sword in his hand
sample-023684,mostly just the hearts of those who are trying to realize their destinies
sample-023685,i got it all ready
sample-023686,here i am between my flock and my treasure the boy thought
sample-023687,and above all don't forget to follow your destiny through to its conclusion
sample-023688,what are these things he asked
sample-023689,and one or two persons were returning
sample-023690,i'll give you a break
sample-023691,the old woman had said the same thing
sample-023692,this was the strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space
sample-023693,let me out of here
sample-023694,i have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk which was embedded in the ground
sample-023695,dense clouds of smoke or dust can be seen through a powerful telescope
sample-023696,and the alchemist understood that the boy's heart had returned to the soul of the world
sample-023697,something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top
sample-023698,the wind began to pick up
sample-023699,all things are one
sample-023700,what do you mean it's okay
sample-023701,it was starlight and i explained the signs of the zodiac to her
sample-023702,the book that most interested the boy told the stories of the famous alchemists
sample-023703,lighthouses in a foggy world
sample-023704,who are these people
sample-023705,but he didn't stop
sample-023706,i'm going to tell her what i think of her
sample-023707,he remembered the sword
sample-023708,a touch of colic
sample-023709,where your treasure is there also will be your heart the alchemist had told him
sample-023710,where did he keep his money
sample-023711,with all of it
sample-023712,i failed to reach a conclusive interpretation
sample-023713,there is no wine in this country the young man said
sample-023714,all this happened between sunrise and sunset the boy thought
sample-023715,he ran his fingers slowly over the stones sensing their temperature and feeling their surfaces
sample-023716,i'm going to take over a lot of plates and things
sample-023717,i heard a faint movement under my feet
sample-023718,toward the end of the afternoon they came upon a coptic monastery
sample-023719,you're the one who may die the alchemist said
sample-023720,that was the law of hospitality
sample-023721,she could still be alive
sample-023722,the two were taken to a nearby military camp
sample-023723,i looked at the cylinder again and was completely terrified
sample-023724,they blow across the world without a birthplace and with no place to die
sample-023725,maybe tomorrow said the boy moving away
sample-023726,why the shots stopped after the tenth no one on earth has tried to explain
sample-023727,the streamer of gas came out towards us
sample-023728,in his heart he wanted to remain awake but he also wanted to sleep
sample-023729,the other son was a poet and delighted all of rome with his beautiful verses
sample-023730,there were just drawings coded instructions and obscure texts
sample-023731,we need to be confident all of us
sample-023732,maybe it was because they moved around so much
sample-023733,they went to the kitchen at the back of the monastery
sample-023734,even coming down on the train together she wrote me
sample-023735,the wind began to blow again
sample-023736,there's no time like the present
sample-023737,so now i'm a camel driver
sample-023738,now i'm beginning what i could have started ten years ago
sample-023739,the heather was on fire and you could see a thin blue smoke rising up slowly
sample-023748,another person was there to help him toward his destiny
sample-023749,i wished i had a light to smoke by
sample-023758,my wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red green and yellow signal lights
sample-023759,i went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the dark
sample-023760,so how will we name all these hurricanes
sample-023761,you wanna take this outside
sample-023762,you want the moon
sample-023763,i wonder what's keeping mother
sample-023764,two horsemen waiting ahead of them
sample-023765,and there were dunes rocks and plants that insisted on living where survival seemed impossible
sample-023766,i told you that your dream was a difficult one
sample-023767,i asked him to let me use the kitchen for a while the alchemist smiled
sample-023770,but he decided first to buy his bakery and put some money aside
sample-023771,it's the emerald tablet said the englishman proud that he might teach something to the boy
sample-023772,they mounted their horses and rode out in the direction of the pyramids of egypt
sample-023773,absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
sample-023774,given only the public key it is very hard to compute the private one
sample-023775,how do you mean
sample-023776,what else are you
sample-023777,why there's oceans of room here
sample-023788,turn on the lights
sample-023789,the boy continued to listen to his heart as they crossed the desert
sample-023798,they went to the kitchen at the back of the monastery
sample-023799,at night they spread their sleeping gear and kept their fires hidden
sample-023808,he's looking for you
sample-023809,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
sample-023818,i can always go back to being a shepherd the boy thought
sample-023819,the following night the boy appeared at the alchemist's tent with a horse
sample-023820,towering buildings form the quintessential skyline
sample-023821,the boy was relieved
sample-023822,i need you to be spontaneous he asked me out to din din
sample-023823,when did you get back
sample-023824,but maybe i'll never have another chance to get to the pyramids in egypt
sample-023825,they were racing down the streets with no regard for anyone
sample-023826,some do come back
sample-023827,you don't have to be rich skinny popular or even own a cape to perform a random act of kindness
sample-023830,finally i didn't have to feel guilty for using my computer on weekends
sample-023831,judge tully is in
sample-023832,i don't care if you've been after it for six years
sample-023833,graham had trained rigourously
sample-023834,the boy noticed that the man's clothing was strange
sample-023835,if it were he would already have heard of it
sample-023836,my review of the sun one star
sample-023837,and a glass of milk
sample-023840,the desert didn't answer him for a few moments
sample-023841,but we could sell tea in crystal glasses
sample-023842,but the boy was certain that he had been looking at them
sample-023843,i haven't any hard feelings
sample-023844,if you want it you must take it
sample-023845,marty helped capture the remagen bridge
sample-023846,i've actually fallen in love with him
sample-023847,not with my money
sample-023848,in any case the desert was impassable
sample-023849,the crowd swayed a little as i elbowed my way through
sample-023850,down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
sample-023851,fill this place with a sandstorm so strong that it blots out the sun
sample-023852,the boy reminded the old man that he had said something about hidden treasure
sample-023853,you're worth your weight in gold
sample-023854,ogilvy watched till one and then gave up
sample-023855,everyone is just standing by the building waiting to get in
sample-023856,that bold remark will be remembered for a long time
sample-023857,a card hanging in the doorway announced that several languages were spoken in the shop
sample-023858,this is a trick to get your sympathy
sample-023859,what do you think you're doing
sample-023860,i can clean up those glasses in the window if you want said the boy
sample-023861,why didn't you say something
sample-023862,suddenly the monster disappeared
sample-023863,they were always just somebody to fill up the bleachers
sample-023864,i'd like you to take me there if you can
sample-023865,i'm interested only in the present
sample-023866,the oxygen's only to help him till the doctor gets here
sample-023867,i don't like coconuts
sample-023868,suddenly the monster disappeared
sample-023869,heads popping back behind doors
sample-023870,he voyaged on a ship called beagle
sample-023871,its lower end was still embedded
sample-023872,it's a nasty day
sample-023873,it swayed in the air like weeping willows
sample-023874,the years of research the magic symbols the strange words and the laboratory equipment
sample-023875,which one is mine
sample-023876,he arose and taking up his crook began to awaken the sheep that still slept
sample-023877,i can't find it anywhere
sample-023878,and i want you to know that i'm coming back
sample-023879,they made the boy continue digging but he found nothing
sample-023880,and of course it's not very customizable
sample-023881,from atop its walls one can catch a glimpse of africa
sample-023882,he prepared himself a sandwich and drank some hot tea from a crystal glass
sample-023883,then he realized that he had been distracted for a few moments looking at the sword
sample-023884,no the alchemist answered
sample-023885,but i'm going to egypt the boy said
sample-023886,the englishman prodded him and the boy asked her about the man who cured people's illnesses
sample-023887,no one said a word as the old man continued
sample-023888,your heart is alive
sample-023889,there were raised voicesand some sort of struggle appeared to be going on 
sample-023890,sit down and let me treat you to something said the boy
sample-023891,there must be a language that doesn't depend on words the boy thought
sample-023892,since the miner had sacrificed everything to his destiny the old man decided to become involved
sample-023893,it seemed such a little thing so bright and small and still
sample-023894,he rose and made his way back toward the palm trees
sample-023895,he opened the package and tucked into a sandwich
sample-023896,at once he connected the two incidents
sample-023897,they worked from early morning till late evening
sample-023898,the police finally manage to get him out of the park
sample-023899,do i look as funny as you do
sample-023900,i'm loving it
sample-023901,so then try he said to the englishman
sample-023902,it was faintly marked with transverse stripes and slightly flattened from the perfect round
sample-023903,when he reached the top of the dune his heart leapt
sample-023904,he regretted having spoken to the camel driver about what he had seen in the desert
sample-023905,the guy thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to stop him
sample-023906,the boy waited and then interrupted the old man just as he himself had been interrupted
sample-023907,he had never even wept in front of his own sheep
sample-023908,before the sun had reached its high point five hundred tribesmen appeared on the horizon
sample-023909,it was glaringly hot not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind
sample-023910,we lit the lantern and walked over to his house
sample-023911,its lower end was still embedded
sample-023912,but as he saw them lying there on the ground another phrase came to his mind
sample-023913,then the thing came upon him in a flash
sample-023914,the lead had dried into the shape of the pan but it was no longer lead
sample-023915,i got it back
sample-023916,what's the matter with you boys
sample-023917,my review of the sun one star
sample-023918,well why don't you go to mecca now asked the boy
sample-023919,his soul must be too primitive to understand those things he thought
sample-023920,people say strange things the boy thought
sample-023921,this is for you
sample-023922,they don't see that the fields are new and the seasons change
sample-023923,how do you know what they're doing
sample-023924,sometimes i appear in the form of a solution or a good idea
sample-023925,as he looked at the stones he felt relieved for some reason
sample-023926,i locked eyes with a fish in the tank
sample-023927,no one attacks an oasis
sample-023928,it was bunched up and he had hardly thought of it for a long time
sample-023929,is it for humans
sample-023930,the tribal chieftain called for the boy and presented him with fifty pieces of gold
sample-023931,they rented a boat and went down the river
sample-023932,the boy was sad as he left her that day
sample-023933,another dreamer said the ticket seller to his assistant watching the boy walk away
sample-023934,it's as much my fault as yours
sample-023935,they set off running wildly into the trees
sample-023936,he took back his books and packed them away again in their bags
sample-023937,what a load of trash sarah opined
sample-023938,you can't believe it's not butter
sample-023939,that's why i feel that i deserve a part of what you find
sample-023940,it was a very warm october
sample-023941,down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
sample-023942,she sends for you
sample-023943,do you understand that
sample-023944,can i get a woot woot
sample-023945,no wonder you jumped in the river
sample-023946,the boy was startled
sample-023947,go and speak to the tribal chieftains said the camel driver
sample-023950,from that day on it was the desert that would be important
sample-023951,what's all this mess
sample-023952,it infuriates me and i don't know why
sample-023953,his father said no more
sample-023954,it had toppled over the brim and fallen into the pit
sample-023955,but then he remembered that he wasn't going to have to pay anything
sample-023956,he remembered something his grandfather had once told him that butterflies were a good omen
sample-023957,advertisements are rarely hosted by the same web server as the actual content
sample-023968,he tried again to concentrate on the pink shades of the desert and its stones
sample-023969,and he hadn't perceived them because he had become accustomed to them
sample-023978,so what do you want of me the sun asked
sample-023979,people said that gypsies spent their lives tricking others
sample-023980,this is keith miller
sample-023981,maktub the boy said remembering the crystal merchant
sample-023982,the window opened outward
sample-023983,throughout the night the boy dug at the place he had chosen but found nothing
sample-023984,he wants me to write down only things that i think about but not things i plan to do
sample-023985,servants came and went with silver trays laden with spices and tea
sample-023986,you won't have any trouble reading it
sample-023987,i've got indigestion
sample-023990,the boy wanted to believe that his friend had simply become separated from him by accident
sample-023991,the closer he got to the realization of his dream the more difficult things became
sample-023992,what is it about
sample-023993,you know i'd tell you if i had it
sample-023994,there's that reprieve if they ever find out
sample-023995,when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
sample-023996,she saved the lives of every man on that transport
sample-023997,it was almost as if her life had been deleted
sample-024008,we want to see you
sample-024009,i know its dimensions and how it behaves
sample-024018,you can't go any farther one of them said
sample-024019,i only interpret dreams
sample-024020,from the railway station in the distance came the sound of trains ringing and rumbling
sample-024021,i myself heard nothing of that
sample-024022,there was very little talking
sample-024023,why didn't you ask neal about it
sample-024024,the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
sample-024025,we didn't steal it
sample-024026,ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
sample-024027,inverse kinematics are a mathematical challenge for robot engineers
sample-024030,there was very little talking
sample-024031,eventually the merchant had to hire two more employees
sample-024032,it was dropping off in flakes and raining down on the sand
sample-024033,the greatest authority on meteorites stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles
sample-024034,there's life here the boy said to the alchemist
sample-024035,a boy came running towards me
sample-024036,but she hadn't charged him anything
sample-024037,but the englishman appeared not to attach any importance to it
sample-024040,and the solid part was called the philosopher's stone
sample-024041,the octopus worried the squid
sample-024042,but he decided first to buy his bakery and put some money aside
sample-024043,but he knew that salem wasn't in andalusia
sample-024044,your dentist called yesterday
sample-024045,why the shots stopped after the tenth no one on earth has tried to explain
sample-024046,i'm coming fatima he said
sample-024047,please don't make me
sample-024048,how long since we've seen each other
sample-024049,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
sample-024050,i have the money i need to buy my sheep
sample-024051,i was expecting you
sample-024052,he wasn't asking for help
sample-024053,a whiskey is the perfect end to my day
sample-024054,mary told me that she got to meet up with you while she was back in san francisco
sample-024055,he was twenty minutes from his tent and began to make his way there
sample-024056,then she took both of his hands in hers and began quietly to pray
sample-024057,maybe we'd better ask someone the boy suggested
sample-024058,amy's a genius at research
sample-024059,what's so illogical about that
sample-024060,the constitution of his flat was not optimal
sample-024061,i was impatient to see it opened
sample-024062,if it were he would already have heard of it
sample-024063,some went away while i was there and other people came
sample-024064,yes that's what love is
sample-024065,what kind of blow should one deliver next in order to remain alive
sample-024066,he started to read the book he had bought
sample-024067,even the guides spoke very little to one another
sample-024068,the merchants were assembling their stalls and the boy helped a candy seller to do his
sample-024069,you're doing a great job so far
sample-024070,all that time the martians must have been getting ready
sample-024071,the boy put the stones in his pouch
sample-024072,look at what we went through today
sample-024073,they're calling to us not to give up and to keep on fighting
sample-024074,whenever he saw the sea or a fire he fell silent impressed by their elemental force
sample-024075,my mind ran on the possibilities of its content
sample-024076,even then he hardly understood what this meant
sample-024077,as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
sample-024078,one of these days is tomorrow
sample-024079,he was shaken into wakefulness by someone
sample-024080,that's true enough the boy thought ruefully
sample-024081,this behavior of neural networks is sometimes called dreaming
sample-024082,i heard a faint movement under my feet
sample-024083,one night the father had a dream
sample-024084,i'll tell you in a minute
sample-024085,why was it that he wanted the boy to serve as his instrument
sample-024086,is that what you want me to tell vincent
sample-024087,after two hours he returned to the room where the wise man was
sample-024088,today was the day their lives would change forever
sample-024089,the arab accepted them without a word
sample-024090,just you and i
sample-024091,it said that the darkest hour of the night came just before the dawn
sample-024092,by the light of their own destruction i saw them staggering and falling and their supporters turning to run
sample-024093,the secretary tugged at a loose fibre
sample-024094,you ought to know that
sample-024095,the boy reminded the old man that he had said something about hidden treasure
sample-024096,raleigh scattering is percieved by humans as very beautiful
sample-024097,she looks kind of bored
sample-024098,they all gathered in manchester
sample-024099,he's pretty young for that job
sample-024100,he prepared himself a sandwich and drank some hot tea from a crystal glass
sample-024101,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
sample-024102,why the shots stopped after the tenth no one on earth has tried to explain
sample-024103,lots of places sell tea around here the merchant said
sample-024104,this was the strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space
sample-024105,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
sample-024106,they stood there looking at the moon
sample-024107,i want you to help me turn myself into the wind the boy answered
sample-024108,i have already found my treasure
sample-024109,death doesn't change anything the boy thought
sample-024110,explanations are illogical and confusing
sample-024111,this is the morning post you're talking to
sample-024112,i've had this shop for thirty years
sample-024113,and he gave the boy his blessing
sample-024114,maktub thought the boy
sample-024115,the boy watched as his companion went to his horse and withdrew a scimitar
sample-024116,but only speak a word and my servant will be healed
sample-024117,thailand turned out to be a very satisfying holiday
sample-024118,says for us to go the limit
sample-024119,most meteorites are more or less rounded
sample-024120,he was so ashamed that he wanted to cry
sample-024121,several figures approached him
sample-024122,tell them it's a case of serious delirium
sample-024123,but they were not there
sample-024124,absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
sample-024125,then the thing came upon him in a flash
sample-024126,the gods should not have desires because they don't have destinies
sample-024127,and i'd better read your books said the boy
sample-024128,it was glaringly hot not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind
sample-024129,i would have won the junior olympics if not for those medaling kids
sample-024130,he recited an our father silently
sample-024131,i havent seen her in ages and i hope she remembers me still
sample-024132,in those days very few of the people had any idea about astronomy
sample-024133,everywhere there were stalls with items for sale
sample-024134,what time is it
sample-024135,it was more activity than usual for this time of the morning
sample-024136,the girl dropped the container and the water spilled
sample-024137,go through with what
sample-024138,bob lifted the dusty scroll
sample-024139,well then why did you let me do it the boy asked
sample-024140,nothing's going to happen
sample-024141,the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
sample-024142,the boy looked around him at the date palms
sample-024143,that's when he'll be safe and not a minute before
sample-024144,where you got him
sample-024145,on the seventh day the alchemist decided to make camp earlier than usual
sample-024146,but don't worry the alchemist continued
sample-024147,this will help you effectively collaborate with developers and coordinate crossteam projects throughout your career
sample-024150,if he ever decided to leave them they would suffer
sample-024151,a boy came running towards me
sample-024152,jennifer is making the nine o'clock train
sample-024153,in one he had read that many years ago a famous arabian alchemist had visited europe
sample-024154,he saw the boy appear from the other side of the dunes
sample-024155,we'll carry the desk over
sample-024156,but you are in the desert
sample-024157,it could prove fatal for them as well as yourself
sample-024168,he was twenty minutes from his tent and began to make his way there
sample-024169,jitterbugs john and the colonel
sample-024178,the top of the cylinder was rotating on its body
sample-024179,another trick the boy thought
sample-024180,a large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered
sample-024181,but now the sounds inside had stopped
sample-024182,but you will love her and she'll return your love
sample-024183,many telescopes were pointed at it
sample-024184,the boy laughed  out of happiness
sample-024185,he could sell the stones and buy a return ticket
sample-024186,with the wars between the tribes it's impossible to cross the desert
sample-024187,their faces were covered with the blue cloths and their eyes showed fear
sample-024190,it's the other foreigner the englishman
sample-024191,the thought was so dreadful to him that he forgot about the heat and went forward
sample-024192,they began to ride out over the sands with the moon lighting their way
sample-024193,we wiped the board
sample-024194,it was there that the wise man lived
sample-024195,i locked eyes with a fish in the tank
sample-024196,the boy was surprised and then irritated
sample-024197,we ignore the other parents who dont speak french
sample-024208,i want you to be my wife
sample-024209,the boy said nothing
sample-024218,keep your shirt on
sample-024219,christine valued her freedom and would never deny anyone that privilege
sample-024220,i don't want to change anything because i don't know how to deal with change
sample-024221,only when he consents
sample-024222,from that day on it was the desert that would be important
sample-024223,the boy turned to the hand that wrote all
sample-024224,there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
sample-024225,the families will be here soon
sample-024226,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
sample-024227,no that's not what i mean
sample-024230,i'll bet it's a summons
sample-024231,this morning i found a calculator taped to my wii
sample-024232,sometime during the second year you'll remember about the treasure
sample-024233,some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound
sample-024234,where have you been for so long
sample-024235,so that was it
sample-024236,you'll marry fatima and you'll both be happy for a year
sample-024237,but i found it difficult to get to work because of the investigations
sample-024240,the one we pick has gotta be the typical average person
sample-024241,because they're still here
sample-024242,suddenly a huge quantity of green smoke came out of the pit in three puffs and went straight into the still air
sample-024243,the problem is that they don't even realize that they're walking a new road every day
sample-024244,let them take me
sample-024245,not unless we're blind
sample-024246,he wasn't asking for help
sample-024247,the alchemist is two hundred years old the englishman had told him
sample-024248,tell me more about your dream said the woman
sample-024249,where have you been
sample-024250,he came to understand its dodges and tricks and to accept it as it was
sample-024251,she has always been very kind and friendly to everyone even strangers
sample-024252,but they were not there
sample-024253,came to the bar he had entered on his first day there
sample-024254,nobody knows how much ammunition the military has in its checkpoints
sample-024255,should be drinking milk
sample-024256,i heard a faint movement under my feet
sample-024257,i'm an old superstitious arab and i believe in our proverbs
sample-024258,the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
sample-024259,look out where you're pointing that gun
sample-024260,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
sample-024261,a line of flame high can be seen in the atmosphere
sample-024262,you can't believe it's not butter
sample-024263,that night there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet
sample-024264,a boy came running towards me
sample-024265,it didn't bring with it the smell of the desert nor the threat of moorish invasion
sample-024266,the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees
sample-024267,and i'm certain you'll find it the alchemist said
sample-024268,everyone seemed very excited
sample-024269,wearing his new sandals he descended the stairs silently
sample-024270,everyone toasted the bride and groom
sample-024271,that song reminds me of my childhood
sample-024272,they set off running wildly into the trees
sample-024273,if i had told you you wouldn't have seen the pyramids
sample-024274,a whole week in bermuda
sample-024275,not everyone can see his dreams come true in the same way
sample-024276,where are you going
sample-024277,is this the place
sample-024278,wait till we get home
sample-024279,the requirements are rather high for this job
sample-024280,you have been a real blessing to me
sample-024281,they are so used to me that they know my schedule he muttered
sample-024282,that saved his life
sample-024283,to continue his search for the treasure meant that he had to abandon fatima
sample-024284,a monk dressed in black came to the gates
sample-024285,you have a mania for simplifying everything answered the englishman irritated
sample-024286,and you know it
sample-024287,but when the reign of tiberius ended his poems were forgotten
sample-024288,it was dropping off in flakes and raining down on the sand
sample-024289,everything in the universe evolved he said
sample-024290,dense clouds of smoke or dust can be seen through a powerful telescope
sample-024291,some went away while i was there and other people came
sample-024292,for a moment everything was dark and scary
sample-024293,i ain't seen him for a week
sample-024294,you've forgotten my milk
sample-024295,his father said no more
sample-024296,suddenly he disappeared and i could hear a faint shriek behind the walls
sample-024297,in any case the desert was impassable
sample-024298,he put a sign on the door and they went to a small cafe nearby
sample-024299,this makes me feel funny
sample-024300,another trick the boy thought
sample-024301,he felt uneasy at the man's presence
sample-024302,they can be a museum a nearby town a park or any place that i have never been before
sample-024303,we'll just start by impounding the post property
sample-024305,people saw me coming and welcomed me he thought
sample-024306,then came the night of the first falling star
sample-024307,did you see the garden that it took the master gardener ten years to create
sample-024308,i don't think i follow you
sample-024309,if he ever decided to leave them they would suffer
sample-024310,some went away while i was there and other people came
sample-024311,it said that the darkest hour of the night came just before the dawn
sample-024312,if you start your emails with greetings let me be the first to welcome you to earth
sample-024313,like when you go into a drugstore
sample-024314,yeah i like that
sample-024315,he thought of the merchant's daughter and was sure that she had probably married
sample-024316,and the girl pointed to the south indicating that it was there the strange man lived
sample-024317,he didn't want to cry with the other people there
sample-024318,is there no sense of honor left in this country
sample-024319,i have the diet of a kid who found twenty dollars
sample-024320,i would have won the junior olympics if not for those medaling kids
sample-024321,he had understood the story the old king had told him
sample-024322,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
sample-024323,the woman said she had never heard of such a person and hurried away
sample-024324,i'm looking for a treasure said the boy and he immediately regretted having said it
sample-024325,he should have decided to become a shepherd the boy said
sample-024326,the world speaks many languages the boy thought
sample-024327,because life wants you to achieve your destiny
sample-024328,ogilvy watched till one and then gave up
sample-024329,he watched the hawks as they drifted on the wind
sample-024330,that's true the boy thought
sample-024331,they were known as seers and they were held in fear by women and the elderly
sample-024332,it spread through the planet's atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features
sample-024333,do you tell lies
sample-024334,he didn't want any conversation at this point
sample-024335,the wireless joypad was experiencing connection issues
sample-024336,the boy was surprised at his thoughts
sample-024337,the gods should not have desires because they don't have destinies
sample-024339,some went away while i was there and other people came
sample-024340,looking up he saw a pair of hawks flying high in the sky
sample-024341,one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
sample-024342,has he been here
sample-024343,because for him you are a green field from which he always returns with game
sample-024344,c'mon over and join our party
sample-024345,the tribal chieftains will see that and you'll be dismissed from your position as counselor
sample-024346,but he kept the sword in his hand
sample-024347,the government decided to focus on border control because of the refugees
sample-024350,our galaxy the milky way apparently contains dark matter
sample-024351,his hands began to tremble and the woman sensed it
sample-024352,all the joy he had seen that morning had suddenly disappeared
sample-024353,before him was an enormous white horse rearing over him with a frightening scream
sample-024354,he really was a king a wise king
sample-024355,you have been a real blessing to me
sample-024356,it's called the principle of favorability
sample-024357,the wind's curiosity was aroused something that had never happened before
sample-024368,the ghost laughed in the weirdest way
sample-024369,here's two thousand dollars
sample-024378,the boy knew a lot of people in the city
sample-024379,the boy stood up shakily and looked once more at the pyramids
sample-024380,until then he had considered the omens to be things of this world
sample-024381,i have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk which was embedded in the ground
sample-024382,i still say that this john doe person is a myth
sample-024383,what had been next to him five minutes ago was now at the other side
sample-024384,i phoned but nobody answered
sample-024385,then she filled her vessel with water and left
sample-024386,it made me very depressed
sample-024387,it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
sample-024390,the englishman was disappointed
sample-024391,he was so all alone
sample-024392,meanwhile the old man persisted in his attempt to strike up a conversation
sample-024393,it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
sample-024394,sometimes it's smarter to wait while sometimes you should act
sample-024395,i shall make us some ice cubes
sample-024396,so now i'm a camel driver
sample-024397,the omens had been true after all
sample-024408,when the sun sets the men will once again surrender their arms to me
sample-024409,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
sample-024418,i have the diet of a kid who found twenty dollars
sample-024419,dense clouds of smoke or dust can be seen through a powerful telescope
sample-024420,after the disclosure of the doping scandal the winner was deprived of the gold medal
sample-024421,that sobered him a little
sample-024422,i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
sample-024423,he reached over and picked up a shell from the ground
sample-024424,this is the first phase of the job he said
sample-024425,the vertex was out of alignment
sample-024426,you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
sample-024427,he moved about invisible but everyone could hear him
sample-024430,but as time passed tangier had changed
sample-024431,there's nothing more we can do tonight
sample-024432,i can interpret it but the interpretation is very difficult
sample-024433,it was impossible to remember all the details that he covered in an hour
sample-024434,but he decided first to buy his bakery and put some money aside
sample-024435,the old man said nothing
sample-024436,he's allergic to him
sample-024437,trust in your heart but never forget that you're in the desert
sample-024440,my job requires a lot of travelling
sample-024441,voice dictation latency is high enough that it's almost always an advantage to accomplish everything in a single command
sample-024442,the boy recalled the brilliance he had noticed on the previous day
sample-024443,now what are you going to do
sample-024444,don't try to enter into the life of the oasis
sample-024445,he thought of the merchant's daughter and was sure that she had probably married
sample-024446,they were strange books
sample-024447,you'll marry fatima and you'll both be happy for a year
sample-024448,he thought of the merchant's daughter and was sure that she had probably married
sample-024449,hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after
sample-024450,lots of places sell tea around here the merchant said
sample-024451,i heard a faint movement under my feet
sample-024452,the thing's not working
sample-024453,it was however still so hot from its flight through the air
sample-024454,we showed up and gave  minute speeches each
sample-024455,you're worth your weight in gold
sample-024456,february took a book from the shelves
sample-024457,he knew how to shear them and how to slaughter them
sample-024458,fatima appeared at the entrance to the tent
sample-024459,the merchants were assembling their stalls and the boy helped a candy seller to do his
sample-024460,you skinned him alive
sample-024461,i find the need for biometric identification from palm images taken by infrared handheld camera questionable
sample-024463,i feel quite ambivalent about the article
sample-024464,do you understand that
sample-024465,he had already seen many people come and go and the desert remained as it was
sample-024466,came to the bar he had entered on his first day there
sample-024467,where are you bound asked the young arab
sample-024468,i thought i'd buy them some groceries
sample-024469,it seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of here
sample-024470,i dont know how comfortable it would be for a person
sample-024471,there are many languages spoken by things the boy said
sample-024472,you're the hope of the world
sample-024473,i'm not familiar with the books this author wrote
sample-024474,what had been next to him five minutes ago was now at the other side
sample-024475,i think jamie did it
sample-024476,he employed the most cunning of tactics
sample-024477,others stumbled upon the stone by accident
sample-024478,but his heart was speaking of other things
sample-024479,you can't do that
sample-024480,now i'm beginning what i could have started ten years ago
sample-024481,it must have fallen while i was sitting over there
sample-024482,and it knew nothing about love
sample-024483,they were both silent for a time observing the plaza and the townspeople
sample-024484,they placed the symbols of the pilgrimage on the doors of their houses
sample-024485,what would be her first payment on that policy
sample-024486,you didn't have to do any cleaning he said
sample-024487,he sat on a stone and allowed himself to become hypnotized by the horizon
sample-024488,three days from now he would be with the merchant's daughter
sample-024490,but there they saw a crystal shop that offered refreshing mint tea
sample-024491,one afternoon they passed by the encampment of one of the tribes
sample-024492,my greatgrandfather planted this tree
sample-024493,he was proud of himself
sample-024494,get a suite at the imperial and hire some bodyguards
sample-024495,the boy looked out at the horizon
sample-024496,it was starlight and i explained the signs of the zodiac to her
sample-024497,it's up to you
sample-024498,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
sample-024499,i've just sworn in four hundred deputies
sample-024500,who did you talk to
sample-024501,get a load of this
sample-024502,does she have the money
sample-024503,you'll marry fatima and you'll both be happy for a year
sample-024504,i said with the mouth shut
sample-024505,let's get out of here said the new arrival
sample-024506,but don't let him interrupt you
sample-024507,she may be lost
sample-024508,the streamer of gas came out towards us
sample-024509,one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
sample-024510,where are you bound asked the young arab
sample-024511,it's not easy to find the philosopher's stone said the englishman
sample-024512,it must have fallen while i was sitting over there
sample-024513,but the marketplace was empty and he was far from home so he wept
sample-024514,this is for you
sample-024515,looking through the telescope i saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet
sample-024516,coming home a party of tourists passed us singing and playing music
sample-024517,the infidels had an evil look about them
sample-024518,those gangsters get what they deserve
sample-024519,people saw me coming and welcomed me he thought
sample-024520,and what do you do in salem he insisted
sample-024521,the tribal chieftains will see that and you'll be dismissed from your position as counselor
sample-024522,the old man gave a signal and everyone stood
sample-024523,from that day on the oasis would be an empty place for her
sample-024524,only when he himself reveals it
sample-024525,where are we going to put him
sample-024526,the day was dawning and the shepherd urged his sheep in the direction of the sun
sample-024527,it's not easy to find the philosopher's stone said the englishman
sample-024528,looking at the sun he calculated that he would reach tarifa before midday
sample-024529,which one is mine
sample-024530,the thought was so dreadful to him that he forgot about the heat and went forward
sample-024531,but now i'm sad and alone
sample-024532,he recited an our father silently
sample-024533,and he gave the boy his blessing
sample-024534,this wasn't a strange place it was a new one
sample-024535,as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
sample-024536,when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
sample-024537,with the wars between the tribes it's impossible to cross the desert
sample-024538,he ran his fingers slowly over the stones sensing their temperature and feeling their surfaces
sample-024539,and he told what he had seen
sample-024540,love required them to stay with the people they loved
sample-024541,replace the ts in tim tebow's name with any other consonant to get a star wars character
sample-024542,it's extremely suspicious that there's no information about brains that didn't come from a brain
sample-024543,for every ten dead men among our enemies you will receive a piece of gold
sample-024544,there were really i think two or three hundred people elbowing one another
sample-024545,but that was simply because my eye was tired
sample-024546,i shall make us some ice cubes
sample-024547,it brought his heart into his mouth
sample-024550,and also by unhappiness envy and jealousy
sample-024551,the flight attendant winked at the obnoxious passenger seated next to me
sample-024552,i'm afraid you're blocking my view
sample-024553,the top had certainly ceased to rotate
sample-024554,people saw me coming and welcomed me he thought
sample-024555,what a time to be alive
sample-024556,in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
sample-024557,if you start your emails with greetings let me be the first to welcome you to earth
sample-024568,the stranger withdrew the sword from the boy's forehead and the boy felt immensely relieved
sample-024569,he sat looking at the sky for a long time
sample-024578,and this is for me said the alchemist keeping one of the parts
sample-024579,the three fell silent
sample-024580,looking up he saw a pair of hawks flying high in the sky
sample-024581,but he appeared to be unaware of any danger
sample-024582,the drivers carried the freight themselves over such treacherous footing and then reloaded the camels
sample-024583,be sure you soap his head thoroughly
sample-024584,the boy listened quietly
sample-024585,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
sample-024586,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
sample-024587,the merchant was silent for a few moments
sample-024590,but what's all this
sample-024591,we must evacuate the courtyard
sample-024592,the three fell silent
sample-024593,the boy thought it a strange question
sample-024594,then i don't get paid
sample-024595,the war is going to end someday the girl said
sample-024596,i just don't trust anyone who says they've never had hamburger helper
sample-024597,you're the one who may die the alchemist said
sample-024608,neither the radar nor the other instruments detected the stealth bomber
sample-024609,the englishman prodded him and the boy asked her about the man who cured people's illnesses
sample-024618,it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience
sample-024619,when he's an old man he's going to spend a month in africa
sample-024620,you mean the one who drank so much
sample-024621,i'm afraid that if my dream is realized i'll have no reason to go on living
sample-024622,have you got my dough
sample-024623,there are rumors of tribal wars he told them
sample-024624,do you know someone here who cures people's illnesses the boy asked
sample-024625,it's not a battle of good against evil
sample-024626,in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
sample-024627,my dog is an alsatian we call her 'poppy'
sample-024630,he spent the entire morning observing the infrequent comings and goings in the street
sample-024631,a directed graph consists of nodes and edges
sample-024632,you're a man disgusted with all of civilization
sample-024633,he wants me to write down only things that i think about but not things i plan to do
sample-024634,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
sample-024635,we've got something between us nothing can change
sample-024636,then you taught me something of the universal language and the soul of the world
sample-024637,he recited an our father silently
sample-024640,i have to separate out the sulfur
sample-024641,there is only one way to learn the alchemist answered
sample-024642,i won't leave you
sample-024643,the boy was shaking with fear but the alchemist helped him out of the tent
sample-024644,i'm getting out of here and you can't stop me
sample-024645,it's a code said the boy a bit disappointed
sample-024646,i'm going to scream
sample-024647,the treasure is at the pyramids that you already knew
sample-024648,why does a plant turn towards the sun
sample-024649,i get more of a kick out of it that way
sample-024650,coming home a party of tourists passed us singing and playing music
sample-024651,i mostly used it for web browsing and occasionally writing emails
sample-024652,i'll give you three minutes to tell me where she is
sample-024653,its observation probabilities are computed as a product of pixel probabilities
sample-024654,and i'm going to build things
sample-024655,can i get a woot woot
sample-024656,you'll wreck your raincoat
sample-024657,it was a pleasant change from talking to his sheep
sample-024658,they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
sample-024659,should i understand the emerald tablet the boy asked
sample-024660,so immerse yourself in it
sample-024661,the old man wore a breastplate of gold and he knew about my past
sample-024662,well he thought about that the old man said
sample-024663,claire's cupboard was empty
sample-024664,this fireplace is victorian
sample-024665,there was hardly any movement from the pit
sample-024666,some of them had binoculars
sample-024667,the boy approached her to ask about the alchemist
sample-024668,my seven year resume gap is marked not drugs
sample-024669,i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
sample-024670,i came to tell you just one thing the boy said
sample-024671,you wanna take this outside
sample-024672,he said that everything has its own destiny
sample-024673,looking through the telescope i saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet
sample-024674,after all what he had always wanted was just that to know new places
sample-024675,your heart is alive
sample-024676,they said nothing else
sample-024677,but i found it difficult to get to work because of the investigations
sample-024678,then he sat in the sunfilled doorway smoking the hookah
sample-024679,air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
sample-024680,i don't much like change he said
sample-024681,the level ground was blackened as far as one could see and it was still giving off smoke
sample-024682,the boy swore that every time he heard the alarm he would heed its message
sample-024683,and what a way to quit
sample-024684,there were really i think two or three hundred people elbowing one another
sample-024685,i'm the king of salem the old man had said
sample-024686,when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
sample-024687,but i found it difficult to get to work because of the investigations
sample-024688,only in that way would he be able to read the omens
sample-024689,we'll fix you up
sample-024690,the only things that concerned the sheep were food and water
sample-024691,he approached the mass and was surprised at the size and the shape
sample-024692,i am proud of you he said
sample-024693,it had toppled over the brim and fallen into the pit
sample-024694,their faces were hidden behind blue veils with only their eyes showing
sample-024695,so the wind blew with all its strength and the sky was filled with sand
sample-024696,the boy knew and was now working toward it
sample-024697,but don't let that out of your sight
sample-024698,the kangaroo hopped noisily
sample-024699,there's that reprieve if they ever find out
sample-024700,watch over her tonight
sample-024701,i was torn between fear and curiosity
sample-024702,my mind ran on the possibilities of its content
sample-024703,he just took over the bank
sample-024704,the car however was not damaged
sample-024705,of course it is
sample-024706,i'm just too miserable
sample-024707,it's always nice if you can learn something new isn't it
sample-024708,then he dropped his spade picked up his jacket and came out into the road
sample-024709,but the alchemist continued to look to the horizon
sample-024710,he needs three days answered the alchemist
sample-024711,ten minutes ago i had a job
sample-024712,how about that favor
sample-024713,they were both silent for a time observing the plaza and the townspeople
sample-024714,i shall make us some ice cubes
sample-024715,the old woman had said the same thing
sample-024716,never mind the money
sample-024717,a boy came running towards me
sample-024718,mary told me that she got to meet up with you while she was back in san francisco
sample-024719,i'm not working for any other paper
sample-024720,the tea seemed less bitter
sample-024721,they become a part of everything
sample-024722,an huge hole had been made by the impact of the projectile
sample-024723,on the seventh day the alchemist decided to make camp earlier than usual
sample-024724,our deadline is coming up rapidly and we will need help
sample-024725,the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
sample-024726,that couldn't be one of the matthew boys
sample-024727,don't worry about that
sample-024728,it was however still so hot from its flight through the air
sample-024729,i just don't trust anyone who says they've never had hamburger helper
sample-024730,henderson stood up with a spade in his hand
sample-024731,most of them were staring quietly at the big table
sample-024732,when i had my sheep i was happy and i made those around me happy
sample-024733,lucy's a newspaper woman
sample-024734,you didn't have to do any cleaning he said
sample-024735,that is an antelope my son
sample-024736,you could have died after peace had been declared
sample-024737,just thirty short days
sample-024738,i don't know how to turn them into reality
sample-024739,it swayed in the air like weeping willows
sample-024740,nothing's going to happen
sample-024741,he moved about invisible but everyone could hear him
sample-024742,she composed an emotional song in her bedroom
sample-024743,tel aviv is a very gay friendly city
sample-024744,i was impatient to see it opened
sample-024745,i can't very well leave without a pair of water wings
sample-024746,and he gave the boy his blessing
sample-024747,words can hurt very much
sample-024750,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
sample-024751,i'm never more aware of a room's acoustics than when i'm trying to enjoy a snack i have no intention of sharing
sample-024752,so how will we name all these hurricanes
sample-024753,they can't use the jena doug clubs for politics
sample-024754,richard has gone camping by himself
sample-024755,picking up where he left off she finished the list
sample-024756,the biggest living thing is a mushroom
sample-024757,the genies were the spirits of good and evil
sample-024768,among these people were a couple of cyclists a gardener i employed sometimes and a girl carrying a baby
sample-024769,now i will drift gently off to dreamland
sample-024778,the phone rang while she was awake
sample-024779,at other times at a crucial moment i make it easier for things to happen
sample-024780,as the sun rose the men began to beat the boy
sample-024781,i think maybe you'd better
sample-024782,relaxed and unhurried he resolved that he would walk through the narrow streets of tangier
sample-024783,it brought his heart into his mouth
sample-024784,my seven year resume gap is marked not drugs
sample-024785,but i didnt think that it contained any living creature
sample-024786,the top had certainly ceased to rotate
sample-024787,you wanna take this outside
sample-024790,for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
sample-024791,you knew the whole story
sample-024792,upon returning to the wise man he related in detail everything he had seen
sample-024793,they went in to drink the tea which was served in beautiful crystal glasses
sample-024794,and he vanished around the corner of the plaza
sample-024795,even when all you want to do is travel
sample-024796,it's extremely suspicious that there's no information about brains that didn't come from a brain
sample-024797,that's not true the boy said
sample-024800,the boy knew and was now working toward it
sample-024801,the burning fire had been extinguished
sample-024802,the men climbed the hill and they were tired when they reached the top
sample-024803,when i'm eating that's all i think about
sample-024804,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
sample-024805,we're refugees from the tribal wars and we need money the other figure said
sample-024806,how'd you happen to fall in
sample-024807,well then why do we need all these books the boy asked
sample-024810,one night the father had a dream
sample-024811,the merchant turned to a customer who wanted three crystal glasses
sample-024812,it was impossible to remember all the details that he covered in an hour
sample-024813,i can learn something from the desert too
sample-024814,i know it's soon to talk about it
sample-024815,well why did you say that i don't know about love the sun asked the boy
sample-024816,can't you give me another hour
sample-024817,he knew what i was thinking the boy said to himself
sample-024828,and he told what he had seen
sample-024829,well interpret the dream he said
sample-024838,mrs jason is on the phone
sample-024839,i don't want a better one later
sample-024840,hires two personal trainers and make one of them train the other one
sample-024841,it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
sample-024842,but the merchant understood what the boy had said
sample-024843,the tribal chieftains will see that and you'll be dismissed from your position as counselor
sample-024844,in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
sample-024845,he wants me to write down only things that i think about but not things i plan to do
sample-024846,the burning fire had been extinguished
sample-024847,but there was a sixth day the sun went on
sample-024848,most meteorites are more or less rounded
sample-024849,do you mean the speech you're writing
sample-024850,the burning fire had been extinguished
sample-024851,but we could sell tea in crystal glasses
sample-024852,the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
sample-024853,the sea has lived on in this shell because that's its destiny
sample-024854,not that i was listening but i noticed that you sounded really stressed when you were explaining the situation to him
sample-024855,a large piece suddenly came off and fell with a loud and sharp noise
sample-024856,the woman sat down and told him to be seated as well
sample-024857,the men climbed the hill and they were tired when they reached the top
sample-024858,you know i'd tell you if i had it
sample-024859,i don't want to take any chances
sample-024860,one of the worst crooks in town
sample-024861,where was his horse
sample-024862,ten years at the university and here i am in a corral
sample-024863,the boy promised himself that when he returned from egypt he would buy that sword
sample-024864,something happens here you'll have to remember later on
sample-024865,to show you one of life's simple lessons the alchemist answered
sample-024866,who's down there with you
sample-024867,who would have thought that
sample-024868,you shouldn't be here the alchemist answered
sample-024869,i was scared but wasted no time in going out and crossing the bridge to the sand pits
sample-024870,this will help you effectively collaborate with developers and coordinate crossteam projects throughout your career
sample-024871,i have the diet of a kid who found twenty dollars
sample-024872,i just want to dream about mecca
sample-024873,i feel i ought to take care of her
sample-024874,he saw that fatima's eyes were filled with tears
sample-024875,well then help me do that the boy said
sample-024876,in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
sample-024877,i didn't need to waste my time just for this he said
sample-024878,what do you know about miranda
sample-024879,that's big of you
sample-024880,and he asked the boy if he too were in search of the alchemist
sample-024881,my mother just called you
sample-024882,then came the night of the first falling star
sample-024883,the tradition teaches men how to cross the desert and how their children should marry
sample-024884,somewhere you are holding the person i love the boy said
sample-024885,and get me a pen
sample-024886,the whole town's gone crazy
sample-024887,and what do you do in salem he insisted
sample-024888,i own my own house
sample-024889,the boy was surprised at his thoughts
sample-024890,during one of these conversations the driver told of his own life
sample-024891,several figures approached him
sample-024892,gentlemen of the press
sample-024893,now i will drift gently off to dreamland
sample-024894,it's like the camel driver said 'eat when it's time to eat
sample-024895,that's the principle that governs all things he said
sample-024896,i'll work all night until dawn and i'll clean every piece of crystal in your shop
sample-024897,the boy said nothing
sample-024898,she told them to kidnap me
sample-024899,the boy recalled the brilliance he had noticed on the previous day
sample-024900,maybe that's why they give up on it so early too
sample-024901,a line of flame high can be seen in the atmosphere
sample-024902,the englishman vanished too gone to find the alchemist
sample-024903,equation  does not include translation which the text suggests it does
sample-024904,it was the time of day when all of spain slept during the summer
sample-024905,the sun was turned into a golden disk
sample-024906,they formed heaps that are visible a mile and a half away
sample-024907,how do i guess at the future
sample-024908,what good is money to you if you're going to die
sample-024909,why can't you get along with her
sample-024910,the old woman had said the same thing
sample-024911,you know i didn't tell anybody i was coming here
sample-024912,how should i know
sample-024913,i went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the dark
sample-024914,i told him we could teach her to ignore people who waste her time
sample-024915,i didn't come here to have you read my palm he said already regretting having come
sample-024916,hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after
sample-024917,i told the truth and the district attorney knows it
sample-024918,they were surrounded by children curious to look at the animals and people that were arriving
sample-024919,what is an alchemist he asked finally
sample-024920,a large piece suddenly came off and fell with a loud and sharp noise
sample-024921,well then help me do that the boy said
sample-024922,and he decided he would go to see the chiefs of the tribes
sample-024923,a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder
sample-024924,but the boy never took his eye off his new friend
sample-024925,well usually i learn more from my sheep than from books he answered
sample-024926,and you know it
sample-024927,he put his headcloth in place and secured it with a ring made of camel skin
sample-024928,i'm not hiding anything the boy answered
sample-024929,don't say that again
sample-024930,henderson was taking it in
sample-024931,they dismounted and the alchemist said nothing
sample-024932,she knows everything
sample-024933,'and this is what your son said' the angel told the man
sample-024934,i understand that it is your dataset and that it is new
sample-024935,how do you know what they're doing
sample-024936,only you expected it to be like other marriages
sample-024937,you could save that poor devil's life
sample-024938,looking up he saw a pair of hawks flying high in the sky
sample-024939,trust in your heart but never forget that you're in the desert
sample-024948,in any case the desert was impassable
sample-024949,you know very well why
sample-024958,i have come to enquire about the antelope
sample-024959,not to worry said the alchemist
sample-024960,the boy was also saddened his friend was in pursuit of his destiny
sample-024961,everyone on earth has a treasure that awaits him his heart said
sample-024962,the homeless seem to like soup
sample-024963,he wanted to tell him about fatima
sample-024964,he doesn't have anything else
sample-024965,you can't be the wind the wind said
sample-024966,they were fascinating stories each of them lived out his destiny to the end
sample-024967,the shaking disturbed the rat nest
sample-024970,other servants maintained the fires in the hookahs
sample-024971,who do you think
sample-024972,but a lovely chap
sample-024973,everyone seemed very excited
sample-024974,he was alarmed by what had happened
sample-024975,now i will drift gently off to dreamland
sample-024976,he approached the mass and was surprised at the size and the shape
sample-024977,but that was simply because my eye was tired
sample-024988,if he makes a buying mistake it doesn't affect him much
sample-024989,they shouted consolation and promises and went off back to the town again to get help
sample-024998,you have been stopping me
sample-024999,it must have fallen while i was sitting over there
sample-025000,how long is what
sample-025001,the arabs laughed at him and the alchemist laughed along
sample-025002,he approached the mass and was surprised at the size and the shape
sample-025003,at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
sample-025004,the tribal chieftains will see that and you'll be dismissed from your position as counselor
sample-025005,strange images passed through my mind
sample-025006,it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience
sample-025007,the old man gave a signal and everyone stood
sample-025008,he's already killed three men
sample-025009,acne is mainly a problem for teenagers
sample-025010,the homeless seem to like soup
sample-025011,he brought six sheep with him
sample-025012,he can't hurt anybody
sample-025013,when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
sample-025014,the boy thanked him ate it and went on his way
sample-025015,the wind told me that you know about love the boy said to the sun
sample-025016,who is your friend the chief asked
sample-025017,i'm never more aware of a room's acoustics than when i'm trying to enjoy a snack i have no intention of sharing
sample-025018,he's on my phone
sample-025019,i asked him to let me use the kitchen for a while the alchemist smiled
sample-025020,there were mountains in the distance
sample-025021,i'm trying to explain to my mother how to get pictures off her phone
sample-025022,i'm getting out of here and you can't stop me
sample-025023,and that's where the power of love comes in
sample-025024,the library is open to everyone
sample-025025,the briefing room was abandoned
sample-025027,i found myself alone and saw the people on the other side of the pit running away
sample-025028,they could barely see the boy
sample-025029,you don't have to be rich skinny popular or even own a cape to perform a random act of kindness
sample-025030,all i want to do is be let alone
sample-025031,what do you want here today the desert asked him
sample-025033,the letter ain't worth nothing
sample-025034,as long as there is water in a cooking pot the temperature cannot rise above a hundred degrees celsius
sample-025035,you're just like father used to be
sample-025036,at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
sample-025037,there's the door right there
sample-025038,the only things that concerned the sheep were food and water
sample-025039,the horse reared again raising a cloud of dust
sample-025048,why would a king be talking with a shepherd the boy asked awed and embarrassed
sample-025049,curse the moment i met that old man he thought
sample-025058,all the lawyers in the world aren't going to help you
sample-025059,i'm going to find that damned alchemist the englishman thought
sample-025060,there were raised voicesand some sort of struggle appeared to be going on 
sample-025061,there are many tradeoffs between supporting continuous commands and keeping performance high
sample-025062,the lead had dried into the shape of the pan but it was no longer lead
sample-025063,tangier is not like the rest of africa
sample-025064,and you ought to read more about the world answered the englishman
sample-025065,you've forgotten my milk
sample-025066,not with my money
sample-025067,in alchemy it's called the soul of the world
sample-025070,how many times are you gonna call me
sample-025071,there's a place to sit down
sample-025072,there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
sample-025073,take me back there
sample-025074,gold would lose its value
sample-025075,you don't have to be rich skinny popular or even own a cape to perform a random act of kindness
sample-025076,threephase alternating current is an efficient way of transmitting energy
sample-025077,a large piece suddenly came off and fell with a loud and sharp noise
sample-025088,i'm afraid it'll be steve tina
sample-025089,it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
sample-025098,only when he himself reveals it
sample-025099,you'd think i committed some sort of crime
sample-025100,he's in the insurance business
sample-025101,so we their hearts speak more and more softly
sample-025102,he got up early with the idea of finding it
sample-025103,the boy fell to the sand nearly unconscious
sample-025104,he felt invisible among all those young people
sample-025105,i'm only speaking metaphorically of course
sample-025106,sure i know where she lives
sample-025107,an huge hole had been made by the impact of the projectile
sample-025110,the corruption ran deep
sample-025111,you must understand that love never keeps a man from pursuing his destiny
sample-025112,that's what i'm afraid of
sample-025113,i found it out a little late
sample-025114,absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
sample-025115,but horses tire bit by bit
sample-025116,because my eyes are not yet accustomed to the desert the boy said
sample-025117,in a couple of minutes
sample-025128,the streamer of gas came out towards us
sample-025129,he was older and was carrying a small bucket
sample-025138,there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
sample-025139,it was something that i thought could happen only to others never to me
sample-025140,people said that gypsies spent their lives tricking others
sample-025141,i didn't come here to have you read my palm he said already regretting having come
sample-025142,henderson stood up with a spade in his hand
sample-025143,you'll watch them as they grow demonstrating how the world is always changing
sample-025144,maybe she didn't even remember him
sample-025145,to do that successfully i must have no fear of failure

sample-025155,there was no need to imprison them the arabs simply confiscated their horses
sample-025156,but if you can try to make your own decisions

sample-025197,they reminded him of the old man
sample-025198,there goes another scrub lady
sample-025199,the boy didn't want to talk about the pyramids

sample-025210,the boy went to look for the englishman
sample-025211,all they think about is food and water
sample-025212,he moved about invisible but everyone could hear him

sample-025220,from atop its walls one can catch a glimpse of africa

sample-025262,my job requires a lot of travelling
sample-025263,at the first glance it was really not very exciting

sample-025265,the two walked out among the palms
sample-025266,he lost a lot of money through gambling in the casino

sample-025288,i would have won the junior olympics if not for those medaling kids
sample-025289,tell me more about your dream said the woman
sample-025298,at the first glance it was really not very exciting

sample-025317,i've seen guys like you go under before
sample-025328,he ate his dinner in solitude contemplating his solemn task
sample-025329,they're not my sheep anymore he said to himself without nostalgia
sample-025338,he was going to miss the place and all the good things he had learned
sample-025339,there goes another scrub lady
sample-025340,no one seemed to have thought about it that night
sample-025341,at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars
sample-025342,i can interpret it but the interpretation is very difficult
sample-025343,well why did you say that i don't know about love the sun asked the boy
sample-025344,that's the point at which most people give up
sample-025345,he understands the forces of nature
sample-025346,what's the matter with my brain
sample-025347,mostly just the hearts of those who are trying to realize their destinies
sample-025348,the two men exchanged some words in arabic and the bar owner seemed irritated

sample-025359,two cents worth of shoelaces
sample-025360,the cup handle has broken
sample-025361,nice of you to come down
sample-025362,yet it was a little too large for assurance

sample-025364,for crying out loud
sample-025365,i'm getting trevor ready
sample-025366,you said you wanted fireworks
sample-025367,i wanted the doll but the auction became too expensive
sample-025368,but he kept quiet because he had heard what the alchemist said to the monk
sample-025369,but then he remembered that he wasn't going to have to pay anything
sample-025370,they erased all evidence of their crimes
sample-025371,the boy waited and then interrupted the old man just as he himself had been interrupted
sample-025372,there was a hole there among the stones
sample-025373,who the heck is johnny
sample-025374,luckily there was a zebra crossing
sample-025375,yorkshire is my county
sample-025376,i'm going to hate those who have found their treasure because i never found mine

sample-025378,which one of these men is it
sample-025379,hold on a minute
sample-025380,at once he connected the two incidents
sample-025381,how are you doing
sample-025382,they also began to feel that they knew a better way than others had
sample-025383,all this happened between sunrise and sunset the boy thought
sample-025384,this is why alchemy exists the boy said
sample-025385,the level ground was blackened as far as one could see and it was still giving off smoke
sample-025386,there's a caravan leaving today for alfayoum
sample-025387,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
sample-025388,tomorrow at this same time bring me a tenth of your flock

sample-025390,i am in search of that universal language among other things
sample-025391,there were raised voicesand some sort of struggle appeared to be going on 
sample-025392,so the boy was disappointed he decided that he would never again believe in dreams
sample-025393,want me to hang paintings at their convenience
sample-025394,but then they wouldn't be a part of your future the seer had said
sample-025395,he knew what i was thinking the boy said to himself
sample-025396,and ask for a glass of wine for me
sample-025397,he's pretty young for that job
sample-025398,he told fatima that at their next meeting
sample-025399,liz put the flowers into a mirrored vase
sample-025400,the computer was going insane it displayed garbled nonsense and then shut down
sample-025401,look at the bottle you took the powder from
sample-025402,i wanted to sleep a little longer he thought
sample-025403,but he had to move on
sample-025404,the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
sample-025405,three days from now he would be with the merchant's daughter
sample-025406,you've got about two minutes
sample-025407,but horses tire bit by bit
sample-025408,ask the owner of that stall how much the sword costs he said to his friend
sample-025409,it'll be for life
sample-025410,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
sample-025411,revenge is not my style but obviously accidents will happen
sample-025412,he ran his fingers slowly over the stones sensing their temperature and feeling their surfaces
sample-025413,it is all right
sample-025414,thank god you're there
sample-025415,i suppose that's true in a way
sample-025416,i went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the dark
sample-025417,no one can be from many places the boy said
sample-025418,but he decided to take a chance
sample-025419,you've got something on your mind
sample-025420,suddenly for no apparent reason the boy's horse began to slow
sample-025421,he placed urim and thummim in the chest
sample-025422,i'm only speaking metaphorically of course
sample-025423,somebody pushed against me and i almost fell into the ditch
sample-025424,first he had studied esperanto then the world's religions and now it was alchemy
sample-025425,last time i made the mistake of replicating a drawing by rodin
sample-025426,my roommates boyfriend is taking up two shelves of fridge space with his beer
sample-025427,not everyone can see his dreams come true in the same way
sample-025428,he told fatima that at their next meeting
sample-025429,you don't have to make all that fuss about it
sample-025430,i need one more
sample-025431,i'm surprised you didn't run into her
sample-025432,they can't use the jena doug clubs for politics
sample-025433,she's a wonderful person
sample-025434,i'd like you to take me there if you can
sample-025435,there is no letter
sample-025436,the boy didn't want to talk about the pyramids
sample-025437,but fatima's hands held to the handles of her jug
sample-025438,it's candice now on long distance from washington
sample-025439,some went away while i was there and other people came
sample-025448,i don't think it's very ethical reading other people's stuff
sample-025449,if i'm on the march i just concentrate on marching
sample-025458,aren't you going to tell me
sample-025459,curse the moment i met that old man he thought
sample-025460,that's the point at which most people give up
sample-025461,they filled three sacks
sample-025462,you'd better get dressed
sample-025463,he didn't want his hand to begin trembling showing the old woman that he was fearful
sample-025464,i have a lunch date
sample-025465,it always gets me right here
sample-025466,the idea frightened him
sample-025467,the treasure is at the pyramids that you already knew
sample-025470,i'm so hungry i could faint
sample-025471,he was just and good
sample-025472,you'll live and you'll learn that a man shouldn't be so stupid
sample-025473,don't be a fool
sample-025474,the caravan would be very lucky to reach the oasis
sample-025475,i was scared but wasted no time in going out and crossing the bridge to the sand pits
sample-025476,it doesn't matter he said to his sheep
sample-025477,they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
sample-025488,i wouldn't live in it as a ghost
sample-025489,then the thing came upon him in a flash
sample-025498,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
sample-025499,the ashtray was empty
sample-025500,i was never so tired in my life
sample-025501,i went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the dark
sample-025502,he didn't want his hand to begin trembling showing the old woman that he was fearful
sample-025503,but i felt miserable watching him wither away like a shriveled dandelion
sample-025504,never ever have a boxing match with ali
sample-025505,they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
sample-025506,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
sample-025507,the boy approached her to ask about the alchemist
sample-025510,the shop is exactly the size i always wanted it to be
sample-025511,mecca is a lot farther away than the pyramids
sample-025512,be less complicated without a family
sample-025513,the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
sample-025514,they're just a pile of stones
sample-025515,this is why alchemy exists the boy said
sample-025516,we never lost a match against them
sample-025517,they were men of the desert and they were fearful of sorcerers
sample-025528,he nodded and said nothing
sample-025529,it was the time of day when all of spain slept during the summer
sample-025538,there's nobody else on the paper who can write
sample-025539,i know what it's going to be like
sample-025540,how can you tell
sample-025541,you lived your life in a loving way and died with dignity
sample-025542,he decided to return to his friend's stable by the longest route possible
sample-025543,he told me i should try to do so
sample-025544,mayonnaise is made from eggs oil vinegar and mustard
sample-025545,remember what happened to lisa
sample-025546,'and this is what your son said' the angel told the man
sample-025547,show me some gratitude
sample-025548,it was the devil
sample-025549,all that time the martians must have been getting ready
sample-025550,don't say those things
sample-025551,my phone is in my back pocket
sample-025552,he reached over and picked up a shell from the ground
sample-025553,the boy was relieved
sample-025554,what do you want here today the desert asked him
sample-025555,i turned and as i did so the screw must have fallen out
sample-025556,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
sample-025557,the references were thick and impenetrable
sample-025558,nothing personal in it
sample-025559,there were monkeys all over the temple
sample-025560,vibrations of peace throughout the tent
sample-025561,there was a moment of silence so profound that it seemed the city was asleep
sample-025562,the wind screamed with delight and blew harder than ever
sample-025563,an elephant on the roof is soon an elephant in the house
sample-025564,two more months passed and the shelf brought many customers into the crystal shop
sample-025565,in order to find the treasure you will have to follow the omens
sample-025566,it was early morning when she woke up
sample-025567,i wished i had a light to smoke by
sample-025568,it helped me to trust in people the englishman answered
sample-025569,the drivers carried the freight themselves over such treacherous footing and then reloaded the camels
sample-025570,you mean the one who drank so much
sample-025571,then leave with the caravan
sample-025572,the plastic barrier shattered
sample-025573,let me speak to her
sample-025574,then the old man began to inspect the sheep and he saw that one was lame
sample-025575,the camel driver was not a fighter and he had consulted with seers
sample-025576,christopher was confused
sample-025577,but he decided first to buy his bakery and put some money aside
sample-025578,from then on the boy understood his heart
sample-025579,the owner of the bar came over and looked as well
sample-025580,you can do this

sample-025588,the thief wasn't there and the owner brought him a cup of tea
sample-025589,no he heard a voice on the wind say
sample-025590,he's the man the ads are written for
sample-025591,he was more confident in himself though and felt as though he could conquer the world
sample-025592,and one or two persons were returning
sample-025593,some went away while i was there and other people came
sample-025594,i'm a woman of the desert she said averting her face
sample-025595,he disappeared into the tent
sample-025596,there were snickers from the background
sample-025597,i don't want to be city sealer
sample-025598,he wrapped the twigs in a piece of cloth and put them back in his bag
sample-025599,they all met during office hours
sample-025600,i got a lot on my mind
sample-025601,there are only eight flags up there now

sample-025603,everyone seemed very excited
sample-025604,i locked eyes with a fish in the tank
sample-025605,the meeting was over
sample-025606,then they got ahold of some dough and went goofy
sample-025607,don't let them see that you're afraid the alchemist said
sample-025608,this morning i found a calculator taped to my wii
sample-025609,better bring me a glass of milk
sample-025610,how did you learn to read the girl asked at one point

sample-025613,i had a momentary impulse to go back and help him but i was too scared to do anything
sample-025614,when i returned to the common the sun was setting
sample-025615,there's a bunch of autograph seekers out front
sample-025616,strange images passed through my mind
sample-025617,a line of flame high can be seen in the atmosphere
sample-025618,i got it back
sample-025619,what are you doing around here
sample-025620,another trick the boy thought

sample-025633,the octopus worried the squid
sample-025634,people continued to come and go from the baker's shop
sample-025635,it doesnt count as screen time if it is a game
sample-025636,one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
sample-025637,among these people were a couple of cyclists a gardener i employed sometimes and a girl carrying a baby
sample-025638,he needs three days answered the alchemist
sample-025639,he approached the mass and was surprised at the size and the shape

sample-025663,but i'm going in search of my treasure the boy said
sample-025664,so then try he said to the englishman
sample-025665,he spent the entire morning observing the infrequent comings and goings in the street
sample-025666,you're looking for witch doctors he spoke some verses from the koran and moved on
sample-025667,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
sample-025670,they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
sample-025671,the newspaper articles had prepared everyone for the reception of the idea
sample-025672,he had found where his treasure was and was frightened at what might happen

sample-025674,the sticker was peeling from the item
sample-025675,pearl williams works for the president
sample-025676,something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top
sample-025677,at once he connected the two incidents
sample-025688,the boy was surprised
sample-025689,and the alchemist understood that the boy's heart had returned to the soul of the world
sample-025698,everyone seemed very excited
sample-025699,there the alchemist separated the disk into four parts
sample-025700,when she saw the unknown object bobbing up and down the edge she was absolutely horrified
sample-025701,but fatima's hands held to the handles of her jug
sample-025702,it's a good thing i got here in time

sample-025739,benjamin was snacking on strips of bacon
sample-025741,they shouted consolation and promises and went off back to the town again to get help

sample-025745,the man wept with happiness
sample-025746,the chilli sauce provided spiciness

sample-025748,that makes sense the alchemist answered
sample-025749,when the simum ceased to blow everyone looked to the place where the boy had been
sample-025750,don't let them get away
sample-025751,our merchants bought that man and brought him to egypt
sample-025752,yet it was a little too large for assurance
sample-025753,how do you think
sample-025755,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
sample-025756,but arms cannot be drawn unless they also go into battle
sample-025757,they all gathered in manchester
sample-025758,this is for the boy
sample-025759,water boarding is a terrible form of torture
sample-025760,that's good thought the englishman
sample-025761,it sounded like a gypsy prayer
sample-025762,the first day passed
sample-025763,the hand with the whip pointed to the south
sample-025764,hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after
sample-025765,the president just decorated him
sample-025766,the monk was irritated

sample-025774,an huge hole had been made by the impact of the projectile
sample-025775,a large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered
sample-025776,some of the grey ash was falling off the circular edge
sample-025777,the fact that the two hours had stretched into an entire year didn't matter
sample-025778,i think perhaps i'd better go to bed
sample-025779,there are many languages spoken by things the boy said
sample-025780,and you ought to read more about the world answered the englishman
sample-025781,then came the night of the first falling star
sample-025782,look at those shoulders
sample-025784,they were given to me as a present by a king the boy said
sample-025785,the problem is that they don't even realize that they're walking a new road every day
sample-025786,treason is a blow that comes unexpectedly

sample-025792,from the railway station in the distance came the sound of trains ringing and rumbling
sample-025793,they showed me at the hospital
sample-025794,somebody should eat the mango i guess it is me
sample-025795,it seemed so safe and tranquil
sample-025796,the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
sample-025798,air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
sample-025799,i'm coming fatima he said
sample-025800,dense clouds of smoke or dust can be seen through a powerful telescope
sample-025801,it's not often that money can save someone's life
sample-025802,after all what he had always wanted was just that to know new places

sample-025816,he condemned the commander to death without honor
sample-025817,what is love the desert asked
sample-025818,he left without saying goodbye to the crystal merchant
sample-025819,my name's heather
sample-025820,what's the good of arguing about something that probably doesn't exist
sample-025821,there's life here the boy said to the alchemist
sample-025822,eventually the merchant had to hire two more employees
sample-025823,that's true enough the boy thought ruefully
sample-025824,a boy came running towards me
sample-025825,he paused for a moment to see if the woman knew what the egyptian pyramids were
sample-025826,that night there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet
sample-025827,i'm never more aware of a room's acoustics than when i'm trying to enjoy a snack i have no intention of sharing

sample-025831,always heed the omens the old king had said
sample-025832,there's the professor now
sample-025833,there was a murmur from the crowd
sample-025834,some went away while i was there and other people came

sample-025836,i had the everyone has gary busey's teeth dream again
sample-025837,do you understand that
sample-025838,just hurry up and get here
sample-025839,it was only when i got this close to it that the strangeness of it was at all evident to me
sample-025840,does she have the money
sample-025841,strange images passed through my mind
sample-025842,you bet your bottom dollar we would

sample-025845,i'm going to build a bridge a mile long
sample-025846,a shepherd may like to travel but he should never forget about his sheep

sample-025850,hang on a second
sample-025851,he appeared with the first stars of evening
sample-025852,he wasn't an alchemist
sample-025853,he paused and his eyes were still unfriendly
sample-025854,the greatest yarn ever written by anybody
sample-025855,the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
sample-025856,the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it

sample-025882,who's gonna get him
sample-025883,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
sample-025884,and he gave the boy his blessing
sample-025885,and better still to be alone with one's books
sample-025886,you don't have to smell the world
sample-025887,heading out to table tennis and i wont be able to make your talk
sample-025890,it was there that the wise man lived
sample-025891,the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
sample-025892,when i first reached through to it i thought the soul of the world was perfect
sample-025893,in order to find the treasure you will have to follow the omens
sample-025894,why would a king be talking with a shepherd the boy asked awed and embarrassed
sample-025895,replace the ts in tim tebow's name with any other consonant to get a star wars character
sample-025896,just thirty short days
sample-025897,in any case the desert was impassable

sample-025920,ten years at the university and here i am in a corral
sample-025921,dense clouds of smoke or dust can be seen through a powerful telescope
sample-025922,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
sample-025923,he has other things to do first
sample-025924,it's not a battle of good against evil
sample-025925,he didn't need to seek out the old woman for this
sample-025926,i saw astonishment and horror on the faces of the people around me
sample-025927,i'm beginning to like this
sample-025930,well interpret the dream he said
sample-025931,only we call them agents
sample-025932,the old woman had said the same thing
sample-025933,i'm the leader of the caravan said a darkeyed bearded man
sample-025934,the hand that evokes love and creates a twin soul for every person in the world
sample-025935,if that guy lays an egg
sample-025936,the heather was on fire and you could see a thin blue smoke rising up slowly
sample-025937,that's the principle that governs all things he said
sample-025940,strange images passed through my mind
sample-025941,an ultimatum from edward and this one's final
sample-025942,this wedge prevents the trailer from rolling down the slope in case of brake failure
sample-025943,something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top

sample-025945,you will never reopen
sample-025946,i'll be right here
sample-025947,then leave with the caravan
sample-025948,it all happened rather suddenly
sample-025949,is it a deal
sample-025950,it's a code said the boy a bit disappointed
sample-025951,another dreamer said the ticket seller to his assistant watching the boy walk away
sample-025952,too much food is being wasted
sample-025953,it didn't bring with it the smell of the desert nor the threat of moorish invasion
sample-025954,i myself heard nothing of that
sample-025955,when she called her friend for help with her computer she repeatedly emphasized that she hadn't done anything
sample-025956,well i'd like to see their land and see how they live said his son
sample-025957,because he knew what he would find
sample-025958,i don't want mrs douglas
sample-025959,at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars
sample-025960,but don't let that out of your sight
sample-025961,you must not let up even after having come so far he continued
sample-025962,people said that gypsies spent their lives tricking others
sample-025963,it wasn't clear to him how to spend his morning time
sample-025964,that's a pack of lies you're telling
sample-025965,it's gonna put our city on the map
sample-025966,the boy waited and then interrupted the old man just as he himself had been interrupted
sample-025968,i wished i had a light to smoke by
sample-025969,in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
sample-025970,i have the diet of a kid who found twenty dollars
sample-025971,i need to sell some wool the boy told the merchant
sample-025972,you're doing a great job so far
sample-025974,this is keith miller
sample-025975,throughout the entire day we will be on the lookout for our enemies
sample-025976,their horses cried out and all their weapons were filled with sand
sample-025977,it seemed so safe and tranquil
sample-025978,what was written on the emerald tablet the boy wanted to know
sample-025979,of course you never did
sample-025980,his soul must be too primitive to understand those things he thought
sample-025981,from the railway station in the distance came the sound of trains ringing and rumbling
sample-025982,my calendar was full that month
sample-025983,it's a dream in the language of the world she said
sample-025984,is this the ear you can't hear on
sample-025985,no the alchemist answered
sample-025986,that's why all children should be nice
sample-025987,but they were not there
sample-025988,not even a stick of gum
sample-025989,the closer he got to the realization of his dream the more difficult things became
sample-025990,is that kimberly's teacher
sample-025991,it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience
sample-025992,henderson was taking it in
sample-025993,henderson was taking it in
sample-025994,now i'm beginning what i could have started ten years ago
sample-025995,they must be used to their new shepherd and have probably already forgotten me
sample-025996,you're a week late for school already
sample-025997,the following night the boy appeared at the alchemist's tent with a horse
sample-025999,she loves to read but is unsure how reading is helping her become more creative
sample-026008,it sure looks good from here
sample-026009,well usually i learn more from my sheep than from books he answered
sample-026018,it was glaringly hot not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind
sample-026019,it was the pure language of the world
sample-026020,go into your dance
sample-026021,he put his headcloth in place and secured it with a ring made of camel skin
sample-026022,you brought a new feeling into my crystal shop
sample-026023,at once he connected the two incidents
sample-026024,the determinant is the product of all eigenvectors of a matrix
sample-026025,the horizon was tinged with red and suddenly the sun appeared
sample-026026,some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound
sample-026027,did you get it
sample-026030,i want to see the chieftains
sample-026031,then you'll die in the midst of trying to realize your destiny
sample-026032,then the thing came upon him in a flash
sample-026033,the president just decorated him
sample-026034,what is an alchemist he asked finally
sample-026035,the boy was shocked
sample-026036,its lower end was still embedded
sample-026037,it's gonna put our city on the map
sample-026040,how long is it
sample-026041,you've got something on your mind
sample-026042,the boy knew the desert sensed his fear
sample-026043,some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound
sample-026044,why did you want to see me the boy asked
sample-026045,the camel driver understood what the boy was saying
sample-026046,he should respect tradition
sample-026047,then came a war
sample-026048,take hold of the cover
sample-026049,the alchemist turned to the boy
sample-026050,do you want to go to work for me the merchant asked
sample-026051,the boy observed in silence the progress of the animals and people across the desert
sample-026052,you must always know what it is that you want the old king had said
sample-026053,the suspension bridge was swinging in the gale
sample-026054,the boy approached her to ask about the alchemist
sample-026055,during the third year the omens will continue to speak of your treasure and your destiny
sample-026056,the burning fire had been extinguished
sample-026057,the alchemist dismounted and told the escorts they could return to the camp
sample-026058,give her the works
sample-026059,you will never be able to escape from your heart
sample-026060,the streamer of gas came out towards us
sample-026061,the englishman was disappointed
sample-026062,it's too bad that he's quickly going to forget my name he thought
sample-026063,maybe he'll give us one
sample-026064,from there he could see africa in the distance
sample-026065,i was impatient to see it opened
sample-026066,give me my book the boy said
sample-026067,i don't want to change anything because i don't know how to deal with change
sample-026068,somebody pushed against me and i almost fell into the ditch
sample-026069,but the englishman was exultant
sample-026070,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
sample-026071,and you've told me about omens
sample-026072,this is the mayor
sample-026073,who's this guy she's gonna marry
sample-026074,this is why alchemy exists the boy said
sample-026075,he saw that fatima's eyes were filled with tears
sample-026076,the boy leapt as well but away from the alchemist
sample-026077,where you got him
sample-026078,i wished i had a light to smoke by
sample-026079,would you like to dance
sample-026080,coming home a party of tourists passed us singing and playing music
sample-026081,he approached the mass and was surprised at the size and the shape
sample-026082,he got up early with the idea of finding it
sample-026083,after all he had all his money
sample-026084,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
sample-026085,there the alchemist separated the disk into four parts
sample-026086,he brought six sheep with him
sample-026087,it was my fear of failure that first kept me from attempting the master work
sample-026088,do you know what's wrong with you
sample-026089,you know you did
sample-026090,the level ground was blackened as far as one could see and it was still giving off smoke
sample-026091,the full network is trained to minimize l pixel loss
sample-026092,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
sample-026093,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
sample-026094,the omens had been true after all
sample-026095,he was tense and upset because he knew that the old man was right
sample-026096,we'll be down with the bags in a minute
sample-026097,coming home a party of tourists passed us singing and playing music
sample-026098,the boy thanked him ate it and went on his way
sample-026099,you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
sample-026100,i've just misplaced eight thousand dollars
sample-026101,and the names of the people involved were very difficult to pronounce
sample-026102,they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
sample-026103,i'd better hustle him up
sample-026104,he prepared himself a sandwich and drank some hot tea from a crystal glass
sample-026105,i'm going out and find them
sample-026106,it won't hurt you and we can make the city edition
sample-026107,the mountain rescue team gave up its work
sample-026108,bert the cop was wounded in north africa
sample-026109,she was reminded of her mistakes
sample-026110,and one or two persons were returning
sample-026111,we'll be down with the bags in a minute
sample-026112,i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
sample-026113,i can only tell you what i saw
sample-026114,these are days of sacrifice
sample-026115,it must have fallen while i was sitting over there
sample-026116,men dream more about coming home than about leaving the boy said
sample-026117,one of us is going to jail
sample-026118,sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
sample-026119,admittedly that is the most expensive coffee ive tasted
sample-026120,i'd like to build a display case for the crystal the boy said to the merchant
sample-026121,he suddenly felt tremendously happy
sample-026122,but horses tire bit by bit
sample-026123,how do you know my name
sample-026124,the boy wanted to take her hand
sample-026125,she's good enough for me
sample-026126,he began to dig at the base of the sycamore
sample-026127,from atop its walls one can catch a glimpse of africa
sample-026128,and because the tribes declared war i went to the well seeking the alchemist
sample-026129,so what should i do now the boy asked
sample-026130,don't be a fool
sample-026131,i was impatient to see it opened
sample-026132,and seizing the boy's bag the alchemist gave the gold coins to the chief
sample-026133,i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit
sample-026134,that it was unable to deal with this boy who spoke the language of the world
sample-026135,i make my living forecasting the future for people he said
sample-026136,he didn't want to cry with the other people there
sample-026137,the three fell silent
sample-026138,he took out his money and counted it
sample-026139,everyone seemed very excited
sample-026140,but now i'm sad and alone
sample-026141,and i think it's terrific
sample-026142,every day was there to be lived or to mark one's departure from this world
sample-026143,i can learn something from the desert too
sample-026144,the boy was relieved
sample-026145,nothing personal in it
sample-026146,this jelly doesn't taste of limes
sample-026147,i got a continuance for a whole month
sample-026150,tonight we give you something entirely new and different
sample-026151,i only interpret dreams
sample-026152,we lit the lantern and walked over to his house
sample-026153,had our instruments permitted it we might have been able to see the trouble way back when
sample-026154,and the leader posted armed sentinels at the fringes of the group
sample-026155,i'm looking for a treasure said the boy and he immediately regretted having said it
sample-026156,we'll have something to drink and eat these hawks
sample-026157,lots of places sell tea around here the merchant said
sample-026168,only in that way would he be able to read the omens
sample-026169,it helped me to trust in people the englishman answered
sample-026178,many telescopes were pointed at it
sample-026179,the pages of the book flipped upside down
sample-026180,because you'll know its dreams and wishes and will know how to deal with them
sample-026181,you knew the whole story
sample-026182,the experience in the coffin was literally immersive
sample-026183,even then he hardly understood what this meant
sample-026184,i'm going home and see my wife and family
sample-026185,but he decided to take a chance
sample-026186,there was a small building there with a window at which people bought tickets to africa
sample-026187,the boy was surprised and then irritated
sample-026190,when he had completed the cleaning he asked the man for something to eat
sample-026191,the greatest authority on meteorites stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles
sample-026192,it's the other foreigner the englishman
sample-026193,then it became a signal of danger
sample-026194,when i returned to the common the sun was setting
sample-026195,he wasn't an alchemist
sample-026196,an huge hole had been made by the impact of the projectile
sample-026197,at this hour of the morning
sample-026208,camels are traitorous they walk thousands of paces and never seem to tire
sample-026209,he arose and taking up his crook began to awaken the sheep that still slept
sample-026218,suddenly the monster disappeared
sample-026219,if someone isn't what others want them to be the others become angry
sample-026220,could you provide an example of a realistic scenario
sample-026221,that's a good idea
sample-026222,get a tray for these great big important leaders
sample-026223,we therefore oppose the resolution
sample-026224,that's a good luck omen the englishman said after the fat arab had gone out
sample-026225,that's why burns is here
sample-026226,we don't know when the war will end so we can't continue our journey he said
sample-026227,even coming down on the train together she wrote me
sample-026230,the two men exchanged some words in arabic and the bar owner seemed irritated
sample-026231,the men were smoking their hookahs and trading stories from the battlefield
sample-026232,that night there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet
sample-026233,the sword remained where it was
sample-026234,it was bunched up and he had hardly thought of it for a long time
sample-026235,why shouldn't i make father my beneficiary
sample-026236,i know its dimensions and how it behaves
sample-026237,i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
sample-026240,he needs three days answered the alchemist
sample-026241,carol hid inside the shipping container
sample-026242,they always do that
sample-026243,what are they doing the old man asked pointing at the people in the plaza
sample-026244,and then he perceived it very slowly
sample-026245,that sobered him a little
sample-026246,on the street where you live
sample-026247,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
sample-026248,then the two went off to have some more tea
sample-026250,the shepherd said nothing
sample-026251,about eleven i walked back to my home in maybury because nothing seemed to be happening
sample-026252,but now the sounds inside had stopped
sample-026253,the manufacturer recommends it
sample-026254,i heard what you were talking about the other day with the alchemist the wind said
sample-026255,my tax dollars pay for those public school proms
sample-026256,looking at the sun he calculated that he would reach tarifa before midday
sample-026257,click twice on the browser's icon to open it
sample-026258,the drivers carried the freight themselves over such treacherous footing and then reloaded the camels
sample-026259,i read only what the birds wanted to tell me
sample-026260,these families have children
sample-026262,is it for humans
sample-026263,why should i be in any danger
sample-026264,is it a deal or isn't it
sample-026265,this samantha tommy movement costs you a fortune
sample-026266,so you can kill me too
sample-026267,classification is among other things a discipline of machine learning
sample-026268,treason is a blow that comes unexpectedly
sample-026269,this horse has more than one horse power
sample-026270,if it were he would already have heard of it
sample-026271,the sheep had taught him that
sample-026272,but he'd have to
sample-026273,it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience
sample-026274,if i could i'd write a huge encyclopedia just about the words luck and coincidence
sample-026276,that tina thought it was funny
sample-026277,used to hunt rabbits there myself
sample-026278,you're losing your eye
sample-026279,this peach tart is tasty
sample-026280,not everything that is faced can be changed but nothing can be changed until it is faced
sample-026281,what do you associate with iceland
sample-026282,there were raised voicesand some sort of struggle appeared to be going on 
sample-026283,who told you that asked the boy startled
sample-026284,he ran his fingers slowly over the stones sensing their temperature and feeling their surfaces
sample-026285,where do you come in
sample-026286,every file had the letter a printed on the front
sample-026287,they were hiding him
sample-026288,when i first reached through to it i thought the soul of the world was perfect
sample-026289,and yet none of these people has ever met the old king
sample-026290,and one or two persons were returning
sample-026291,what good is money to you if you're going to die
sample-026292,you mean you don't approve of my having a baby
sample-026293,programmers like to write code not words
sample-026294,i didn't know shepherds knew how to read said a girl's voice behind him
sample-026295,they're just a pile of stones
sample-026296,where's ashley's wallet
sample-026297,these trousers don't fit very well
sample-026298,the burning fire had been extinguished
sample-026299,it reminded him of the wool from his sheep
sample-026300,sometime during the second year you'll remember about the treasure
sample-026301,you're a big help
sample-026302,and then there were the others who were interested only in gold
sample-026303,her jaw was getting tired from chewing gum
sample-026304,i didn't fall in
sample-026305,visiting a university offers great chances for your career
sample-026306,treason is a blow that comes unexpectedly
sample-026307,they might even have become friends but the englishman closed off the conversation
sample-026308,some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound
sample-026309,the space quickly filled with people
sample-026310,how often do you want to eat
sample-026311,somebody pushed against me and i almost fell into the ditch
sample-026312,he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
sample-026313,so the boy was disappointed he decided that he would never again believe in dreams
sample-026314,we have that all figured out
sample-026315,sometimes it's better to be with the sheep who don't say anything
sample-026316,it belongs to me now
sample-026317,because you are trying to realize your destiny
sample-026318,a man doesn't get in a situation like this every day
sample-026319,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
sample-026320,be careful with your prognostications said the stranger
sample-026321,then like a colony of worker ants they dismantled their stalls and left
sample-026322,the boy laughed  out of happiness
sample-026323,it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-026324,he was alarmed by what had happened
sample-026325,there's a copy on my desk
sample-026326,when i had my sheep i was happy and i made those around me happy
sample-026327,my name's pete davis
sample-026328,that was the law of hospitality
sample-026329,so that those who have the responsibility for understanding can understand he said
sample-026330,they were strange books
sample-026331,we lit the lantern and walked over to his house
sample-026332,the volume wouldn't increase much further
sample-026333,below is a letter which reached my desk this morning
sample-026334,the woman in the red dress is stunning
sample-026335,he ran his fingers slowly over the stones sensing their temperature and feeling their surfaces
sample-026336,all the best
sample-026337,it was not clear who had the right of way since the traffic lights were off
sample-026338,finally a young woman approached who was not dressed in black
sample-026339,and the odor of the animals became a bit more tolerable
sample-026340,i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
sample-026341,help my friend mr richard
sample-026342,you don't have to be rich skinny popular or even own a cape to perform a random act of kindness
sample-026343,he was going to miss the place and all the good things he had learned
sample-026344,if it would save a woman's life
sample-026345,and this is your coat
sample-026346,it seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of here
sample-026347,it would have been visible to me had i only looked up as it passed
sample-026350,why do you think i brought you here
sample-026351,in alchemy it's called the soul of the world
sample-026352,she diluted the broth with chicken stock
sample-026353,a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder
sample-026354,can't you just observe men and omens in order to understand the language the boy asked
sample-026355,stick to your clubs
sample-026356,it must have fallen while i was sitting over there
sample-026357,no one seemed to have thought about it that night
sample-026368,for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
sample-026369,i had seen all that it would presently bring me
sample-026378,the englishman was unable to sleep one night
sample-026379,the boy fell to his knees and wept
sample-026380,a friend of yours
sample-026381,august may have ended early
sample-026382,from atop its walls one can catch a glimpse of africa
sample-026383,i went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the dark
sample-026384,the top of the cylinder was rotating on its body
sample-026385,suddenly for no apparent reason the boy's horse began to slow
sample-026386,my job requires a lot of travelling
sample-026387,i went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the dark
sample-026390,what had been next to him five minutes ago was now at the other side
sample-026391,exactly answered the alchemist
sample-026392,i don't know why
sample-026393,but i didnt think that it contained any living creature
sample-026394,get katherine at the bulletin on the phone
sample-026395,and so despite the fact that he was a roman centurion he converted to their faith
sample-026396,i wanted to sleep a little longer he thought
sample-026397,it must have fallen while i was sitting over there
sample-026408,i guess you forgot something
sample-026409,maybe it was because they moved around so much
sample-026418,a shepherd may like to travel but he should never forget about his sheep
sample-026419,that baker he said to himself without completing the thought
sample-026420,is it for further automatic processing
sample-026421,two days ago you said that i had never dreamed of travel the merchant answered
sample-026422,we want to see you
sample-026423,our merchants bought that man and brought him to egypt
sample-026424,the englishman was unable to sleep one night
sample-026425,i don't know how to find life in the desert the boy said
sample-026426,imagine what we could have achieved together he sobbed
sample-026427,after two hours he returned to the room where the wise man was
sample-026430,some of the grey ash was falling off the circular edge
sample-026431,his way isn't the same as mine nor mine as his
sample-026432,down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
sample-026433,why the shots stopped after the tenth no one on earth has tried to explain
sample-026434,he had no idea how he was going to transform himself into the wind
sample-026435,she was here first
sample-026436,we don't know what's in the confounded thing do you
sample-026437,the boy picked up his pouch and put it with his other things
sample-026440,get your guns out
sample-026441,for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
sample-026442,his speech ended in standing ovations
sample-026443,open a terminal and execute a program
sample-026444,ogilvy watched till one and then gave up
sample-026445,they went on smoking the pipe for a while as the sun began to set
sample-026446,i need one more
sample-026447,can you give me one good reason why i should
sample-026448,where's your coat and hat
sample-026449,and they had understood each other perfectly well
sample-026450,air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
sample-026451,hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after
sample-026452,the alchemist dismounted slowly and the boy did the same
sample-026453,the water was crystal clear
sample-026454,the boy was shocked
sample-026455,now what do you say
sample-026456,i should have repeated it for him
sample-026457,is sam with you
sample-026458,you'll be the counselor of the oasis
sample-026459,you can keep her on
sample-026460,fatima appeared at the entrance to the tent
sample-026461,because life wants you to achieve your destiny
sample-026462,what do you know about that
sample-026463,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
sample-026464,i'm not hiding anything the boy answered
sample-026465,the meeting was over
sample-026466,but he knew that salem wasn't in andalusia
sample-026467,can't you just observe men and omens in order to understand the language the boy asked
sample-026468,it was glaringly hot not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind
sample-026469,where does she get that stuff
sample-026470,i was scared but wasted no time in going out and crossing the bridge to the sand pits
sample-026471,the first day passed
sample-026472,but now the sounds inside had stopped
sample-026473,it made me very depressed
sample-026474,from then on he would make his own decisions
sample-026475,why the shots stopped after the tenth no one on earth has tried to explain
sample-026476,if you start your emails with greetings let me be the first to welcome you to earth
sample-026477,i'm going to them
sample-026478,two days ago you said that i had never dreamed of travel the merchant answered
sample-026479,many people in berkshire surrey and middlesex must have seen it
sample-026480,apple pie is an iconic dish
sample-026481,they mounted their horses and rode out in the direction of the pyramids of egypt
sample-026482,you can only spit out so many seeds
sample-026483,as he was attempting to pull out the rocks he encountered he heard footsteps
sample-026484,not even the tribal chieftains are able to see him when they want to
sample-026485,what were you when you came here five years ago
sample-026486,another hour to write it
sample-026487,i was wondering if you could tell me a bit more about what it's like to live and work there
sample-026488,but it sounds like it won't be fixed until the consumer version which doesn't have a release date yet
sample-026489,are you going to let her out
sample-026490,the boy spent a sleepless night
sample-026491,i bet you she'd know how to say it all right
sample-026492,you would have to have been born an arab to understand he answered
sample-026493,before him was an enormous white horse rearing over him with a frightening scream
sample-026494,only in that way would he be able to read the omens
sample-026495,ten minutes for what
sample-026496,it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience
sample-026497,there must be a language that doesn't depend on words the boy thought
sample-026498,how do i feel
sample-026499,i'm going to become bitter and distrustful of people because one person betrayed me
sample-026500,i need some time to think
sample-026501,the alchemist turned to the boy
sample-026502,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
sample-026503,i have the most beautiful voice you have ever heard
sample-026504,this was the strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space
sample-026505,and their eyes spoke of death
sample-026506,there was no way to measure anything of that length
sample-026507,the man was speaking the language of alchemy
sample-026508,and above all don't forget to follow your destiny through to its conclusion
sample-026509,i shouldn't have done that
sample-026510,i'm afraid the joke's on us
sample-026511,some men were smoking from a gigantic pipe that they passed from one to the other
sample-026512,he waited patiently for the merchant to awaken and open the shop
sample-026514,overall i'm happy with the new device enough that i ordered one for both home and work
sample-026515,when he reached the top of the dune his heart leapt
sample-026516,that was his work
sample-026517,heading out to table tennis and i wont be able to make your talk
sample-026518,you're in luck you two the fat arab said
sample-026519,hundreds must have seen it and taken it for a falling star
sample-026520,and i want you to know that i'm coming back
sample-026521,mrs sarah doesn't either
sample-026522,but he decided first to buy his bakery and put some money aside
sample-026523,i want to stay at the oasis the boy answered
sample-026524,sometimes there's just no way to hold back the river
sample-026525,of course the two were unable to do anything
sample-026526,the horseman was completely immobile as was the boy
sample-026527,and also by unhappiness envy and jealousy
sample-026528,i'm interested only in the present
sample-026529,and look how many things the wind already knew how to do
sample-026530,see if you can get us seats near the umbrellas
sample-026531,he's not a failure
sample-026532,i just don't trust anyone who says they've never had hamburger helper
sample-026533,of course the two were unable to do anything
sample-026534,there's a caravan leaving today for alfayoum
sample-026535,at his side was the young arab the boy had spoken with earlier
sample-026536,at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars
sample-026537,your eyes show the strength of your soul answered the alchemist
sample-026538,that day the merchant gave the boy permission to build the display
sample-026539,you wanna take this outside
sample-026540,the man looked at him without responding
sample-026541,the night was warm and i was thirsty
sample-026542,you bet i've got a better offer
sample-026543,on the third day the chief met with his officers
sample-026544,the immense collection of people and animals began to travel faster
sample-026545,why don't you fellows get your own news
sample-026546,there were raised voicesand some sort of struggle appeared to be going on 
sample-026547,and it's not love to see everything from a distance like you do
sample-026550,the top of the cylinder was rotating on its body
sample-026551,so it's better to listen to what it has to say
sample-026552,as they moved along the boy tried to listen to his heart
sample-026553,you bet your bottom dollar we would
sample-026554,gypsies are experts at getting people to do that sighed the old man
sample-026555,the two men hurried back and found the cylinder still lying in the same position
sample-026556,the top had certainly ceased to rotate
sample-026557,but the marketplace was empty and he was far from home so he wept
sample-026568,the two were taken to a nearby military camp
sample-026569,because you will never again be able to keep it quiet
sample-026578,and the murmur lasted longer than a simple vow would have
sample-026579,he wants me to write down only things that i think about but not things i plan to do
sample-026580,he's allergic to him
sample-026581,i ain't seen him for a week
sample-026582,we're refugees from the tribal wars and we need money the other figure said
sample-026583,the merchant was silent for a few moments
sample-026584,you'd think i was on the witness stand
sample-026585,ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
sample-026586,but the englishman appeared not to attach any importance to it
sample-026587,they were relieved and happy
sample-026590,i pointed out mars a bright dot of light
sample-026591,and they attacked an empty tent
sample-026592,i don't believe it
sample-026593,nearby was the englishman reading a book
sample-026594,everybody quiet and ready for an emergency
sample-026595,it seemed such a little thing so bright and small and still
sample-026596,but i found it difficult to get to work because of the investigations
sample-026597,they began to ride out over the sands with the moon lighting their way
sample-026608,he regretted having spoken to the camel driver about what he had seen in the desert
sample-026609,i would appreciate if you could create a concise table
sample-026618,the airplane rose gracefully into the sky
sample-026619,they have gotten used to my being away and so have i
sample-026620,he just got a new kite for his birthday
sample-026621,it seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of here
sample-026622,you're hurting my sore foot
sample-026623,get me a rewrite woman
sample-026624,what about higgins against becca
sample-026625,all i saw was an army said the boy
sample-026626,all that time the martians must have been getting ready
sample-026627,but my heart is agitated the boy said
sample-026630,the boy brought his horse closer
sample-026631,his dessert smelled musty not sweet
sample-026632,hires two personal trainers and make one of them train the other one
sample-026633,i'm an old superstitious arab and i believe in our proverbs
sample-026634,the treasure is at the pyramids that you already knew
sample-026635,an alchemist said the alchemist
sample-026636,i would put it up there
sample-026637,the oasis is neutral ground
sample-026640,air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
sample-026641,that woman is gonna be on that roof
sample-026642,you haven't got your wings yet
sample-026643,he had understood the story the old king had told him
sample-026644,did you make a speech
sample-026645,tomorrow at this same time bring me a tenth of your flock
sample-026646,but finally he agreed that the boy who spoke better arabic than he should do so
sample-026647,eventually the merchant had to hire two more employees
sample-026648,you don't have to apologize
sample-026649,as soon as he saw me among the crowd he called to me to come down
sample-026650,you'll be the only one who'll swipe any of it
sample-026651,the boy was startled
sample-026652,i promised that i would make my own decisions he said to himself
sample-026653,the boy was suddenly happy to be there at the warehouse
sample-026654,there was very little talking
sample-026655,a line of flame high can be seen in the atmosphere
sample-026656,how are you feeling
sample-026657,you must not let up even after having come so far he continued
sample-026658,he dressed in his arabian clothing of white linen bought especially for this day
sample-026659,it was my fear of failure that first kept me from attempting the master work
sample-026660,got to be a sergeant
sample-026661,and that's my farewell to the newspaper game
sample-026662,i need to sell some wool the boy told the merchant
sample-026663,because now he knew where his treasure was
sample-026664,lemons and thyme should go well
sample-026665,but he didn't need to worry about that right now
sample-026666,several figures approached him
sample-026667,you can't offer me something that is already mine the chief said arrogantly
sample-026668,there was a shimmering green light emanating from the statue
sample-026669,i have the money i need to buy my sheep
sample-026670,the alchemist stopped abruptly and bent to the ground
sample-026671,the night was warm and i was thirsty
sample-026672,what's the world's greatest lie the boy asked completely surprised
sample-026673,they'd never let you go
sample-026674,and also because i know about the soul of the world he thought to himself
sample-026675,why can't i skip this damn intro
sample-026676,the shop is exactly the size i always wanted it to be
sample-026677,they went on smoking the pipe for a while as the sun began to set
sample-026678,the boy awoke before dawn
sample-026679,but that was simply because my eye was tired
sample-026680,the heather was on fire and you could see a thin blue smoke rising up slowly
sample-026681,the only things that concerned the sheep were food and water
sample-026682,the sticker was peeling from the item
sample-026683,why the shots stopped after the tenth no one on earth has tried to explain
sample-026684,the boy saw a man appear behind the counter
sample-026685,doesnt it defeat the purpose of hashing
sample-026686,as they moved along the boy tried to listen to his heart
sample-026687,and i will be the policeman
sample-026688,when the simum ceased to blow everyone looked to the place where the boy had been
sample-026689,the englishman was unable to sleep one night
sample-026690,people continued to come and go from the baker's shop
sample-026691,you have a mania for simplifying everything answered the englishman irritated
sample-026692,grandma is fearless
sample-026693,the omens had been true after all
sample-026694,we want to see you
sample-026695,we miss you and miss having a friend like you and i am so happy that you two got to catch up
sample-026696,you must understand that love never keeps a man from pursuing his destiny
sample-026697,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
sample-026698,they were his treasure
sample-026699,didn't you hear him
sample-026700,so the boy was disappointed he decided that he would never again believe in dreams
sample-026701,then she again took his hands and studied them carefully
sample-026702,get the bulletin board
sample-026703,some storms are worth the wreckage
sample-026704,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
sample-026705,the merchant looked anxiously at the boy
sample-026706,men have never understood the words of the wise
sample-026707,do you want to go to work for me the merchant asked
sample-026708,and here's fifty dollars on account
sample-026709,the hand with the whip pointed to the south
sample-026710,flash grenades explode with a loud bang and cause disorientation
sample-026711,it made me very depressed
sample-026712,the interface was indecipherable
sample-026713,what do you say
sample-026714,honest ahmed did not convince the developers
sample-026715,one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
sample-026716,not until the moon was high did the alchemist ride into view
sample-026717,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
sample-026718,instead the stranger lowered it slowly until the point touched the boy's forehead
sample-026719,all this happened between sunrise and sunset the boy thought
sample-026720,the alchemist told the boy to place the shell over his ear
sample-026721,on the first day he returned with a rabbit and on the second with two birds
sample-026722,i don't like people to do that because the sheep are afraid of strangers
sample-026723,the boy looked out at the horizon
sample-026724,where your treasure is there also will be your heart the alchemist had told him
sample-026725,so we their hearts speak more and more softly
sample-026726,as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
sample-026727,she crossed the finish line just in time
sample-026728,without questioning he said what the screen of his computer dictated to him
sample-026729,tomorrow sell your camel and buy a horse
sample-026730,it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
sample-026731,a practice of infidels he said to himself
sample-026732,the guy thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to stop him
sample-026733,i just saw the sheriff
sample-026734,you've never been born
sample-026735,i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
sample-026736,that party was amazing
sample-026737,he noticed the unequal cooling of its surface
sample-026738,it means only that the heart does what it can the alchemist said
sample-026739,he looked like an arab which was not unusual in those parts
sample-026740,your mother and i talked it over half the night
sample-026741,the old man was probably a gypsy too
sample-026742,you been in a fight
sample-026743,among these people were a couple of cyclists a gardener i employed sometimes and a girl carrying a baby
sample-026744,maktub thought the boy
sample-026745,always heed the omens the old king had said
sample-026746,none of what the old man was saying made much sense to the boy
sample-026747,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
sample-026750,but now the sounds inside had stopped
sample-026751,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
sample-026752,the boy climbed the dune slowly
sample-026753,but fatima's hands held to the handles of her jug
sample-026754,the thought was so dreadful to him that he forgot about the heat and went forward
sample-026755,this farm had cattle chicken sheep and many other animals
sample-026756,nature knows me as the wisest being in creation the sun said
sample-026757,it said that the darkest hour of the night came just before the dawn
sample-026768,people saw me coming and welcomed me he thought
sample-026769,the daffodils are blooming
sample-026778,it wasn't clear to him how to spend his morning time
sample-026779,the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
sample-026780,the old man opened his cape and the boy was struck by what he saw
sample-026781,parachuting is dangerous
sample-026782,his hands began to tremble and the woman sensed it
sample-026783,if something isn't done
sample-026784,you would have to have been born an arab to understand he answered
sample-026785,they rented a boat and went down the river
sample-026786,and he wasn't faring much better
sample-026787,he wasn't asking for help
sample-026790,half an hour later his shovel hit something solid
sample-026791,then he sat in the sunfilled doorway smoking the hookah
sample-026792,even then he hardly understood what this meant
sample-026793,the top of the cylinder was rotating on its body
sample-026794,the girl dropped the container and the water spilled
sample-026795,it was only when i got this close to it that the strangeness of it was at all evident to me
sample-026796,what had been next to him five minutes ago was now at the other side
sample-026797,it was my fault for interfering
sample-026800,if that guy lays an egg
sample-026801,it's just exactly what i wanted
sample-026802,i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
sample-026803,the greatest authority on meteorites stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles
sample-026804,it was however still so hot from its flight through the air
sample-026805,they don't see that the fields are new and the seasons change
sample-026806,looking through the telescope i saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet
sample-026807,don't give us that ethics stuff
sample-026810,remember that wherever your heart is there you will find your treasure
sample-026811,the infidels had an evil look about them
sample-026812,so immerse yourself in it
sample-026813,at the first glance it was really not very exciting
sample-026814,but i'm going in search of my treasure the boy said
sample-026815,henderson went into the railway station to telegraph the news to london
sample-026816,i'll be back the boy said
sample-026817,i've already told you
sample-026828,you will never be able to escape from your heart
sample-026829,where are we going
sample-026838,another trick the boy thought
sample-026839,another who was searching the boy's bags found the piece of gold
sample-026840,just by looking at them
sample-026841,where'd you get this
sample-026842,canada is quite cold at times
sample-026843,but the crystal merchant had no choice
sample-026844,the horseman was completely immobile as was the boy
sample-026845,you have been a real blessing to me
sample-026846,we didn't steal it
sample-026847,we've got to produce a show now
sample-026848,it means only that the heart does what it can the alchemist said
sample-026849,i felt a chill down my spine
sample-026850,we lit the lantern and walked over to his house
sample-026851,i went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the dark
sample-026852,he got up adjusted his clothing and picked up his pouch
sample-026853,liz put the flowers into a mirrored vase
sample-026854,its lower end was still embedded
sample-026855,i have the diet of a kid who found twenty dollars
sample-026856,that sobered him a little
sample-026857,what's the world's greatest lie the boy asked completely surprised
sample-026858,criminals cry for it
sample-026859,you can't be the wind the wind said
sample-026860,the englishman could not contain his excitement
sample-026861,let them take me
sample-026862,somewhere you are holding the person i love the boy said
sample-026863,the cake is a lie
sample-026864,henderson went into the railway station to telegraph the news to london
sample-026865,and one or two persons were returning
sample-026866,my father offered her a job
sample-026867,they filled three sacks
sample-026868,who are you he heard a voice ask him in spanish
sample-026869,the level ground was blackened as far as one could see and it was still giving off smoke
sample-026870,you're losing your eye
sample-026871,he paid for the wool and asked the shepherd to come back the following year
sample-026872,i'm going away he said
sample-026873,the beer was more than just refreshing it was delicious
sample-026874,when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
sample-026875,maybe tomorrow said the boy moving away
sample-026876,the boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid responding to her question
sample-026877,for occupying the wrong parking lot he had to pay a fine
sample-026878,all who went there were happy at having done so
sample-026879,let's break the problem down
sample-026880,the angel touched the man's shoulder and they were both projected far into the future
sample-026881,he was dressed only in his pajamas
sample-026882,i'm getting trevor ready
sample-026883,it is i the boy answered
sample-026884,at the first glance it was really not very exciting
sample-026885,it was the first time either had touched the other
sample-026886,maybe because that wasn't really his dream
sample-026887,aunt tiffany and bank teller at the window
sample-026888,as he sat there thinking he sensed movement above him
sample-026889,no the alchemist answered
sample-026890,what's your name he asked
sample-026891,the man looked at him without responding
sample-026892,i've stuck it back together
sample-026893,the levanter was still getting stronger and he felt its force on his face
sample-026894,the newspaper articles had prepared everyone for the reception of the idea
sample-026895,where have you been for so long
sample-026896,i can interpret it but the interpretation is very difficult
sample-026897,pearl williams works for the president
sample-026898,the boy reached the small abandoned church just as night was falling
sample-026899,it was dropping off in flakes and raining down on the sand
sample-026900,three cheers for aden christopher
sample-026901,who told you that asked the boy startled
sample-026902,i was scared but wasted no time in going out and crossing the bridge to the sand pits
sample-026903,i want to talk to both of you
sample-026904,my tax dollars pay for those public school proms
sample-026905,help me the boy said
sample-026906,what are you afraid of melissa
sample-026907,i locked eyes with a fish in the tank
sample-026908,it helped me to trust in people the englishman answered
sample-026909,let them come in
sample-026910,he was tense and upset because he knew that the old man was right
sample-026911,my seven year resume gap is marked not drugs
sample-026912,most of them were staring quietly at the big table
sample-026913,i don't want to change anything because i don't know how to deal with change
sample-026914,it seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of here
sample-026915,gives you an idea of the season
sample-026916,i'll work all night until dawn and i'll clean every piece of crystal in your shop
sample-026917,you wanna take this outside
sample-026918,what's the matter with him
sample-026919,a part of me is also trying to come to terms with the fact that i won't be able to travel as much anymore
sample-026920,the omens had been true after all
sample-026921,it's because you were not born
sample-026922,many people in berkshire surrey and middlesex must have seen it
sample-026923,and i'm certain you'll find it the alchemist said
sample-026924,because for him you are a green field from which he always returns with game
sample-026925,what are these things he asked
sample-026926,he slipped on the stairs
sample-026927,if he makes a buying mistake it doesn't affect him much
sample-026928,henderson was taking it in
sample-026929,i'll just watch him he said to himself
sample-026930,angela is pregnant she told me
sample-026931,everyone seemed very excited
sample-026932,ogilvy watched till one and then gave up
sample-026933,for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
sample-026934,i read only what the birds wanted to tell me
sample-026935,after two hours he returned to the room where the wise man was
sample-026936,earlier this year we found a really nice place near my office and we moved in together
sample-026937,he knew what i was thinking the boy said to himself
sample-026938,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
sample-026939,for dinner they had cesar salad
sample-026948,get me a pitcher's glove
sample-026949,didn't you hear him
sample-026958,and also by unhappiness envy and jealousy
sample-026959,the accommodation was affordable and cosy
sample-026960,did you make a speech
sample-026961,the bootloader shows a dialog prompting to enter the passphrase
sample-026962,i've never had one before the merchant answered
sample-026963,but that was simply because my eye was tired
sample-026964,younger man what he had seen and the man asked him to wait there
sample-026965,you must always know what it is that you want the old king had said
sample-026966,it was only when i got this close to it that the strangeness of it was at all evident to me
sample-026967,but ii had no idea what was going on
sample-026970,i have no information about troops or about the movement of the tribes
sample-026971,the top had certainly ceased to rotate
sample-026972,they were on the right track
sample-026973,it's a pity most people do not know what gearshifts are good for
sample-026974,you have to cross the entire sahara desert said the young man
sample-026975,the two men hurried back and found the cylinder still lying in the same position
sample-026976,the streamer of gas came out towards us
sample-026977,then suddenly he noticed it with a start
sample-026988,wouldn't it be nice if we were like that
sample-026989,you wanna take this outside
sample-026998,carbon monoxide is a very dangerous gas
sample-026999,of course the most important question is whether it actually works better than the old eye tracker
sample-027000,it seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of here
sample-027001,before him was an enormous white horse rearing over him with a frightening scream
sample-027002,the alchemist is two hundred years old the englishman had told him
sample-027003,where do you live shouted the boy as the horseman rode away
sample-027004,a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder
sample-027005,in some places the ground was covered with the salt of driedup lakes
sample-027006,it's called the principle of favorability
sample-027007,it would have been visible to me had i only looked up as it passed
sample-027008,eye trackers used to cost several thousand dollars but now you can grab a cheap one for less than a couple hundred bucks
sample-027009,it was something that i thought could happen only to others never to me
sample-027010,the sword remained where it was
sample-027011,i don't like seals anyhow
sample-027012,because i've always heard about them the boy answered saying nothing about his dream
sample-027013,i shall make us some ice cubes
sample-027014,so he could not be hasty nor impatient
sample-027015,the night was warm and i was thirsty
sample-027016,yes that's what love is
sample-027017,promise you'll never lie the way snoopy did
sample-027018,he really was a king
sample-027019,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
sample-027020,many telescopes were pointed at it
sample-027021,they eat lunch together often but dont really talk outside the office
sample-027022,i'm going with you the boy said
sample-027023,they rode alongside each other gracefully
sample-027024,the sea has lived on in this shell because that's its destiny
sample-027025,i believe what she said
sample-027026,i bet you forgot the wine
sample-027027,as was mecca for the merchant
sample-027028,i'm going to become bitter and distrustful of people because one person betrayed me
sample-027029,that'll close my account
sample-027030,everything's going to be all right
sample-027031,but the boy was quiet
sample-027032,it doesn't matter he said to his sheep
sample-027033,you have helped me the man continued to prepare his tea saying nothing
sample-027034,and he gave the boy his blessing
sample-027035,death doesn't change anything the boy thought
sample-027036,hundreds must have seen it and taken it for a falling star
sample-027037,in my fantasy i can guarantee harmony for all eternity
sample-027038,the buttons made a strange clicking sound when pressed
sample-027039,i'll phone them right away to get that story
sample-027048,i can only tell you what i saw
sample-027049,mary told me that she got to meet up with you while she was back in san francisco
sample-027058,he arose and taking up his crook began to awaken the sheep that still slept
sample-027059,it's true that everything has its destiny but one day that destiny will be realized
sample-027060,you dont compare directly to existing stateoftheart methods
sample-027061,the boy was becoming nervous
sample-027062,the buttons made a strange clicking sound when pressed
sample-027063,you ought to know that
sample-027064,rest well tonight as if you were a warrior preparing for combat
sample-027065,now it will be with hope
sample-027066,the merchant looked anxiously at the boy
sample-027067,just as your grandfather taught you
sample-027070,the sea has lived on in this shell because that's its destiny
sample-027071,the boy was getting irritated
sample-027072,they're not concerned with that right now
sample-027073,having heard that the boy became even more interested in alchemy
sample-027074,you must understand that love never keeps a man from pursuing his destiny
sample-027075,in his heart he wanted to remain awake but he also wanted to sleep
sample-027076,wouldn't do any good
sample-027077,i came to tell you just one thing the boy said
sample-027088,they were on the right track
sample-027089,it was only when i got this close to it that the strangeness of it was at all evident to me
sample-027098,we'll just start by impounding the post property
sample-027099,and a glass of milk
sample-027100,because i don't live in either my past or my future
sample-027101,he forgets the office when he's with me
sample-027102,the following night the boy appeared at the alchemist's tent with a horse
sample-027103,our merchants bought that man and brought him to egypt
sample-027104,the tea seemed less bitter
sample-027105,but maybe i'll never have another chance to get to the pyramids in egypt
sample-027106,he decided to spend the night there
sample-027107,you're not asking a favor of him
sample-027110,i'm going into the desert the man answered turning back to his reading
sample-027111,somebody cut us off
sample-027112,typical american that can keep his mouth shut
sample-027113,we couldn't find the high street
sample-027114,i came to tell you just one thing the boy said
sample-027115,i went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the dark
sample-027116,are you crazy the boy asked the alchemist when they had moved on
sample-027117,they are called private and public key
sample-027128,these families have children
sample-027129,that's why i was sent down here
sample-027138,but maybe people who felt that way had never learned the universal language
sample-027139,you must love the desert but never trust it completely
sample-027140,can't you see what it means to my family
sample-027141,they continued across the desert
sample-027142,at night they spread their sleeping gear and kept their fires hidden
sample-027144,add ray noble to my chill vibes playlist
sample-027145,the alchemist's words echoed out like a curse
sample-027146,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
sample-027147,suddenly for no apparent reason the boy's horse began to slow
sample-027148,it was dropping off in flakes and raining down on the sand
sample-027149,i found myself alone and saw the people on the other side of the pit running away
sample-027150,well then why do we need all these books the boy asked
sample-027151,here it is again
sample-027152,i would have won the junior olympics if not for those medaling kids
sample-027153,i'm at the end of my rope
sample-027154,it seemed so safe and tranquil
sample-027155,of course he's coming back here
sample-027156,even then he hardly understood what this meant
sample-027158,whenever he could he sought out a new road to travel
sample-027159,i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
sample-027160,i've handled a good many big promotions in my time
sample-027161,the men were terrified at his sorcery
sample-027162,i promise i will be careful
sample-027163,that's why i feel that i deserve a part of what you find
sample-027164,the horizon was tinged with red and suddenly the sun appeared
sample-027165,exactly answered the alchemist
sample-027166,they opened the bottle of wine and drank heavily
sample-027167,everything in the universe evolved he said
sample-027168,church and state are seperated for a reason
sample-027169,the man looked at the angel in surprise
sample-027170,however the authors ignore a very large body of work on tone mapping
sample-027171,have you got my dough
sample-027172,with the wars between the tribes it's impossible to cross the desert
sample-027173,we miss you and miss having a friend like you and i am so happy that you two got to catch up
sample-027174,i don't know the desert that well yet
sample-027175,you wanna take this outside
sample-027176,the wind has many names
sample-027177,much better said the old man
sample-027178,this samantha tommy movement costs you a fortune
sample-027179,it's a good face
sample-027181,you must love the desert but never trust it completely
sample-027182,he had never imagined that questions about life would be of such importance to a shepherd
sample-027183,do you know what cia stands for
sample-027184,i've learned things from the sheep and i've learned things from crystal he thought
sample-027185,it could have been steel silver or platinum
sample-027186,it's the only one they had left
sample-027187,he approached the mass and was surprised at the size and the shape
sample-027188,it was his heart that would tell him where his treasure was hidden
sample-027189,all things are one the old man had said
sample-027190,but they were not there
sample-027191,as he did so he talked with the monk about the tribal wars
sample-027192,how often do you want to eat
sample-027193,i shall make us some ice cubes
sample-027195,why'd you want to save me
sample-027196,would you rather leave
sample-027197,however the presentation of the previous work could be deeper
sample-027198,maybe tomorrow said the boy moving away
sample-027199,robin had some sort of date with tracy
sample-027200,always ask an objective question
sample-027201,there's gold here he said
sample-027202,they locked themselves in their laboratories and tried to evolve as gold had
sample-027203,it knew of the boy's talk with the desert because the winds know everything
sample-027204,you're a week late for school already
sample-027205,that might be all right
sample-027206,he approached the mass and was surprised at the size and the shape
sample-027207,this morning i found a calculator taped to my wii
sample-027208,for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
sample-027209,watch out for his venom the boy said
sample-027210,they were always just somebody to fill up the bleachers
sample-027211,at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
sample-027212,it's going to take a while the boy said
sample-027213,you're hurting my sore foot
sample-027214,but you mustn't feel that way
sample-027215,the desert was all sand in some stretches and rocky in others
sample-027216,rated m for mature
sample-027217,they set off running wildly into the trees
sample-027218,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
sample-027219,then how do i know this is your office
sample-027220,it's too bad that he's quickly going to forget my name he thought
sample-027221,who do you want
sample-027222,the alchemists spent years in their laboratories observing the fire that purified the metals
sample-027223,then the thing came upon him in a flash
sample-027224,the volume wouldn't increase much further
sample-027225,he knew what i was thinking the boy said to himself
sample-027226,if you have to wait until the war is over then wait
sample-027227,they called it the simum and it was worse than a storm at sea
sample-027228,now i will drift gently off to dreamland
sample-027229,it was the second or third time they'd tried
sample-027230,but i didn't kill anybody
sample-027231,what on earth are you doing
sample-027232,i was scared but wasted no time in going out and crossing the bridge to the sand pits
sample-027233,is this the ear you can't hear on
sample-027234,you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
sample-027235,at least we've finally got something we can celebrate
sample-027236,i came to tell you just one thing the boy said
sample-027237,but one of them seized the boy and yanked him back out of the hole
sample-027238,people are going off relief
sample-027239,on the second day the boy climbed to the top of a cliff near the camp
sample-027248,where are we going to put him
sample-027249,we've run out of petrol and diesel
sample-027258,i'm not afraid of failing
sample-027259,the two men hurried back and found the cylinder still lying in the same position
sample-027260,they're not for sale he said
sample-027261,the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
sample-027262,so it's better to listen to what it has to say
sample-027263,the president heroically fought against such savagery
sample-027264,the tea seemed less bitter
sample-027265,among these people were a couple of cyclists a gardener i employed sometimes and a girl carrying a baby
sample-027266,now it will be with hope
sample-027267,it picks up on the mike
sample-027270,he was immensely excited at the news
sample-027271,uncle jack and i are going to miss you
sample-027272,why a revolver he asked
sample-027273,no one can verify your results
sample-027274,at his side was the young arab the boy had spoken with earlier
sample-027275,the boy went to his room and packed his belongings
sample-027276,but just before lunchtime a boy stopped in front of the shop
sample-027277,has he been here
sample-027288,how did you learn to read the girl asked at one point
sample-027289,the alchemist turned to the boy
sample-027298,that's what i'm going to do
sample-027299,i didn't tell anybody
sample-027300,the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
sample-027301,i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
sample-027302,he was immensely excited at the news
sample-027303,finally a young woman approached who was not dressed in black
sample-027304,a whole week in bermuda
sample-027305,they went on smoking the pipe for a while as the sun began to set
sample-027306,the level ground was blackened as far as one could see and it was still giving off smoke
sample-027307,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
sample-027310,that day the merchant gave the boy permission to build the display
sample-027311,they have gotten used to my being away and so have i
sample-027312,he's mr big and mr small
sample-027313,it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-027314,we've got to get bail
sample-027315,just by looking at them
sample-027316,it was hard for him to eat less because the food was so good
sample-027317,now his intuition was that he had been right in coming
sample-027328,what is it you're looking for asked the old merchant
sample-027329,i'm trying to explain to my mother how to get pictures off her phone
sample-027338,you like every boy
sample-027339,the boy noticed that the owner of the bar stood nearby listening attentively to their conversation
sample-027340,when i had my sheep i was happy and i made those around me happy
sample-027341,everything in life is an omen said the englishman now closing the journal he was reading
sample-027342,i left when the zoning changed and the real estate market has boomed
sample-027343,it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-027344,the hand that evokes love and creates a twin soul for every person in the world
sample-027345,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
sample-027346,but arms cannot be drawn unless they also go into battle
sample-027347,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
sample-027348,what had been next to him five minutes ago was now at the other side
sample-027349,i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
sample-027350,something older than humanity more ancient than the desert
sample-027351,then the thing came upon him in a flash
sample-027352,you must understand that love never keeps a man from pursuing his destiny
sample-027353,you have to cross the entire sahara desert said the young man
sample-027354,i wouldn't live in it as a ghost
sample-027355,i don't know why these things have to be transmitted by word of mouth he thought
sample-027356,i'll have it in a minute
sample-027357,the drivers carried the freight themselves over such treacherous footing and then reloaded the camels
sample-027358,nobody's trying to steal from you
sample-027359,i'll get it for you
sample-027360,you already know about alchemy
sample-027361,he's out duckshooting now
sample-027362,i'll work all night until dawn and i'll clean every piece of crystal in your shop
sample-027363,i'm glad you gentlemen are here
sample-027364,i want to see that map covered before we get through
sample-027365,how should i know
sample-027366,how much do you make a week
sample-027367,younger man what he had seen and the man asked him to wait there
sample-027368,i was wondering if you would work on this project with me because i cant find anyone else
sample-027369,don't let anybody in or out
sample-027370,ten years at the university and here i am in a corral
sample-027371,i'll just watch him he said to himself
sample-027372,he won't leave the circle
sample-027373,the football jocks laughed viciously
sample-027374,the handle snagged my coat
sample-027375,i don't want anything for myself
sample-027376,and then the boy understood
sample-027377,he began to dig at the base of the sycamore
sample-027378,but don't take my word for it
sample-027379,the burning fire had been extinguished
sample-027380,he moved about invisible but everyone could hear him
sample-027381,sometimes it's better to be with the sheep who don't say anything
sample-027382,this morning i found a calculator taped to my wii
sample-027383,he knew he was stronger than his friend
sample-027384,my palms were sweaty and my mouth was dry it must be a phobia
sample-027385,i'm beginning to like this
sample-027386,maybe tomorrow said the boy moving away
sample-027387,i'm the stranger around here
sample-027388,he was more certain of it than of anything in the world
sample-027389,and you've told me nothing along the way said the boy
sample-027390,he got up early with the idea of finding it
sample-027391,the boy was relieved
sample-027392,he was immensely excited at the news
sample-027393,there was surely a baker in her town
sample-027394,the townsfolk were all chumps
sample-027395,yet it was a little too large for assurance
sample-027396,the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
sample-027397,you brought a new feeling into my crystal shop
sample-027398,where'd you wire him
sample-027399,i've always looked on bessie as my own sister
sample-027400,victoria does things in a much bigger way
sample-027401,what's my name doing on it
sample-027402,i haven't won my wings yet
sample-027403,each snowflake is as unique as a grain of sand
sample-027404,revenge is not my style but obviously accidents will happen
sample-027405,the thing's not working
sample-027406,but the king of salem hoped desperately that the boy would be successful
sample-027407,the article should contain url where the dataset can be downloaded
sample-027408,i shall make us some ice cubes
sample-027409,as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
sample-027410,the boy was relieved
sample-027411,he wasn't asking for help
sample-027412,i didn't know shepherds knew how to read said a girl's voice behind him
sample-027413,i only interpret dreams
sample-027414,i wish they'd stop that practicing
sample-027415,he seemed unfriendly and had looked irritated when the boy had entered
sample-027416,it was impossible to remember all the details that he covered in an hour
sample-027417,and if you improve on the present what comes later will also be better
sample-027418,i'm sure i don't know what you're talking about
sample-027419,the invaders carried the name everywhere the beautiful girl spoke of the invaders with pride
sample-027420,on the first day he returned with a rabbit and on the second with two birds
sample-027421,symbols of the little people
sample-027422,be careful with your prognostications said the stranger
sample-027423,i need ten dollars
sample-027424,just teach me to be the wind for a few moments the boy said
sample-027425,but now i'm sad and alone
sample-027426,you have enough gold to buy many sheep and many camels
sample-027427,and he wasn't faring much better
sample-027428,three to two in our favor
sample-027429,the telephone didn't work without electricity
sample-027430,as the englishman left fatima arrived and filled her vessel with water
sample-027431,somebody had returned my lost credit card to the bank
sample-027432,from the railway station in the distance came the sound of trains ringing and rumbling
sample-027433,she has chipped a fingernail
sample-027434,all that time the martians must have been getting ready
sample-027435,i've got a flash for you
sample-027436,the electrician looked puzzled
sample-027437,i only interpret dreams
sample-027438,we've got to get to them
sample-027439,i came to tell you just one thing the boy said
sample-027448,even then he hardly understood what this meant
sample-027449,he'll drive you batty
sample-027458,as he looked at the stones he felt relieved for some reason
sample-027459,got to be a sergeant
sample-027460,i saw astonishment and horror on the faces of the people around me
sample-027461,i thought tonight i'd put miss kelly there
sample-027462,i'd die for either of you
sample-027463,another trick the boy thought
sample-027464,other servants maintained the fires in the hookahs
sample-027465,the bootloader shows a dialog prompting to enter the passphrase
sample-027466,the boy didn't know what a person's destiny was
sample-027467,the boy knew the desert sensed his fear
sample-027470,the boy felt ill and terribly alone
sample-027471,if you start your emails with greetings let me be the first to welcome you to earth
sample-027472,i thought that everything i owned would be destroyed
sample-027473,down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
sample-027474,it infuriates me and i don't know why
sample-027475,don't you know me
sample-027476,i'm afraid i already know a great many people
sample-027477,it brought his heart into his mouth
sample-027488,the conversation was interrupted by the warehouse boss
sample-027489,i know she writes them
sample-027498,i never said i'd take it
sample-027499,you can't believe it's not butter
sample-027500,some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound
sample-027501,the boy was also saddened his friend was in pursuit of his destiny
sample-027502,he decided to spend the night there
sample-027503,but that was simply because my eye was tired
sample-027504,but you are forcing me to look at wealth and at horizons i have never known
sample-027505,my seven year resume gap is marked not drugs
sample-027506,the area was swirling in dust so intense that it hid the moon from view
sample-027507,he recorded everything with his camcorder to have a watertight proof
sample-027510,help me the boy said
sample-027511,i pointed out mars a bright dot of light
sample-027512,of course this is just the beginning
sample-027513,tomorrow is another day
sample-027514,my tax dollars pay for those public school proms
sample-027515,angela is pregnant she told me
sample-027516,the same hand that had brandished the sword now held a whip
sample-027517,it goes on the calendar for next week
sample-027528,i shall make us some ice cubes
sample-027529,we therefore oppose the resolution
sample-027538,wait till martha hears about this
sample-027539,having heard that the boy became even more interested in alchemy
sample-027540,mr nelson come yet
sample-027541,what am i going to say to elvis
sample-027542,and if you ask me that's a phoney letter
sample-027543,you wanna take this outside
sample-027544,what do you want to know
sample-027545,some storms are worth the wreckage
sample-027546,after all the spinning had stopped megan felt better
sample-027547,it's a code said the boy a bit disappointed
sample-027548,do you see this
sample-027549,why are you carrying money asked the tribesman when he had searched the boy's bag
sample-027550,beat it out and get hold of some guys
sample-027551,is john really a snow
sample-027552,the boy waited and then interrupted the old man just as he himself had been interrupted
sample-027553,and he immediately felt peace in his heart
sample-027554,he started to read the book he had bought
sample-027555,the men climbed the hill and they were tired when they reached the top
sample-027556,the reader just needs to know what it does
sample-027557,he walked slowly through the market
sample-027558,all things are one
sample-027559,they rode for the entire day
sample-027560,on the seventh day the alchemist decided to make camp earlier than usual
sample-027561,do you read me
sample-027562,the boy knew the desert sensed his fear
sample-027563,why do you want to find that sort of person the arab asked
sample-027564,but you mustn't feel that way
sample-027565,then the thing came upon him in a flash
sample-027566,but that's why you created the game in the first place the boy answered
sample-027567,he had found where his treasure was and was frightened at what might happen
sample-027568,the boy began to dig into the dune
sample-027569,at once he connected the two incidents
sample-027570,he has other things to do first
sample-027571,they tell their incredible stories at the time when you want to hear them
sample-027572,i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
sample-027573,i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
sample-027574,they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
sample-027575,until my wing went bad
sample-027576,where are you from the boy asked
sample-027577,he paid for the wool and asked the shepherd to come back the following year
sample-027578,it always helps to be learning something new and exciting
sample-027579,i'll dig up that five thousand somehow
sample-027580,lioness rushes to defense of cub
sample-027581,everything on earth is being continuously transformed because the earth is alive
sample-027582,let me comb your hair
sample-027583,that's good thought the englishman
sample-027584,i'm never more aware of a room's acoustics than when i'm trying to enjoy a snack i have no intention of sharing
sample-027585,but he kept the sword in his hand
sample-027586,'everyone loved them and enjoyed them
sample-027587,saul was infuriating the others
sample-027588,you should see the other guy specifically how good at fighting he is
sample-027589,the boy was surprised
sample-027590,i'm only speaking metaphorically of course
sample-027591,for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
sample-027592,i locked eyes with a fish in the tank
sample-027593,she and heather were talking
sample-027594,drinking and driving is irresponsible
sample-027595,we owed everybody in town
sample-027596,i'm going to go back to doing just what i did before the boy thought
sample-027597,we'll be down with the bags in a minute
sample-027598,and your camels will bring you wealth and power
sample-027599,there was no response from the elders
sample-027600,he was betting on that outcome
sample-027601,it was only when i got this close to it that the strangeness of it was at all evident to me
sample-027602,they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
sample-027603,i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
sample-027604,the old man wore a breastplate of heavy gold covered with precious stones
sample-027605,their horses cried out and all their weapons were filled with sand
sample-027606,it was a tent like many at the oasis
sample-027607,exactly answered the alchemist
sample-027608,now i can see that it hasn't been too bad
sample-027609,the boy's heart began to speak of fear
sample-027610,what do i do in salem the old man laughed
sample-027611,but just before lunchtime a boy stopped in front of the shop
sample-027612,the boy climbed the dune slowly
sample-027613,but most important he was able every day to live out his dream
sample-027614,as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
sample-027615,anita passed out during gymnastics she recovered quickly
sample-027616,he had not a cent in his pocket but he had faith
sample-027617,but now the sounds inside had stopped
sample-027618,i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
sample-027619,if only we could see it
sample-027620,i need to sell some wool the boy told the merchant
sample-027621,it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
sample-027622,the secret is here in the present
sample-027623,i looked at the cylinder again and was completely terrified
sample-027624,it's past your bedtime
sample-027626,a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder
sample-027627,the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
sample-027628,henderson stood up with a spade in his hand
sample-027629,the guy thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to stop him
sample-027630,you have told me about your dreams about the old king and your treasure
sample-027632,don't ask me why i don't know why
sample-027633,we were all made by the same hand and we have the same soul
sample-027634,if it were he would already have heard of it
sample-027635,fatima appeared at the entrance to the tent
sample-027636,they're forming clubs
sample-027637,he took back his books and packed them away again in their bags
sample-027638,give me some carrots and other vegetables i'm going to feed the rabbits
sample-027639,they don't like those articles i've been writing
sample-027648,the boy was shaking with fear but the alchemist helped him out of the tent
sample-027649,that's what i'd like to know
sample-027658,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
sample-027659,it's extremely suspicious that there's no information about brains that didn't come from a brain
sample-027660,the car engine has seized
sample-027661,he stood irresolute for a moment and then scrambled out of the pit
sample-027662,who told you that asked the boy startled
sample-027663,the crowd swayed a little as i elbowed my way through
sample-027664,chickens lay so many eggs a week it wouldn't be possible to breed them all
sample-027665,you wanna take this outside
sample-027666,did you know that kevin marcus is back from school
sample-027667,they opened the bottle of wine and drank heavily
sample-027670,there were raised voicesand some sort of struggle appeared to be going on 
sample-027671,but there were certain of them who took a bit longer to awaken
sample-027672,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
sample-027673,too bad he has to be fed on a bottle
sample-027674,well then we've got a problem
sample-027675,there was very little talking
sample-027676,but before i go i want to tell you a little story
sample-027677,they never found the secret
sample-027688,you don't have to be rich skinny popular or even own a cape to perform a random act of kindness
sample-027689,i never saw her before
sample-027698,it spread through the planet's atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features
sample-027699,got anything new on the hanging
sample-027700,the boy and the englishman had bought camels and climbed uncertainly onto their backs
sample-027701,are you running a business or a charity ward
sample-027702,the usb device didn't function correctly
sample-027703,just by looking at them
sample-027704,now that's too much
sample-027705,the quicker the better
sample-027706,the men fell into an animated discussion
sample-027707,the brake fluid was leaking out onto the path
sample-027710,you came so that you could learn about your dreams said the old woman
sample-027711,never mind those guys
sample-027712,but the boy sat down and waited
sample-027713,i did not see her but i heard
sample-027714,because you have already lost your savings twice
sample-027715,you're the only one left
sample-027716,mr lee can't be bothered now
sample-027717,the boy watched the exchange with fascination
sample-027728,i have the money i need to buy my sheep
sample-027729,i wish i was up there with them
sample-027738,well then we've got a problem
sample-027739,there the alchemist separated the disk into four parts
sample-027740,the boy said nothing
sample-027741,it was dropping off in flakes and raining down on the sand
sample-027742,his life and his path had always provided him with enough omens
sample-027743,are you going to listen
sample-027744,you got someplace to sleep
sample-027745,that's why i'm here
sample-027746,i was wondering if you would work on this project with me because i cant find anyone else
sample-027747,an old man with a breastplate of gold wouldn't have lied just to acquire six sheep
sample-027748,don't say that again
sample-027749,i still find the article to be unnecessarily obscure
sample-027750,he didn't want his hand to begin trembling showing the old woman that he was fearful
sample-027751,but i found it difficult to get to work because of the investigations
sample-027752,the boy thought about the crystal merchant
sample-027753,but there was something there in his heart that wouldn't allow him to do so
sample-027754,can you get in this desk
sample-027755,how come you speak spanish he asked
sample-027756,you're the biggest person in town
sample-027757,japanese culture is incredibly addictive their buildings look amazing
sample-027758,there's a caravan leaving today for alfayoum
sample-027759,the animals were exhausted and the men talked among themselves less and less
sample-027760,i can't do that
sample-027761,down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
sample-027762,there are rumors of tribal wars he told them
sample-027763,wait till those two future jailbirds read the morning post tomorrow
sample-027764,are you really fred's brother
sample-027765,not until the moon was high did the alchemist ride into view
sample-027766,without responding the guard entered the tent where he remained for some time
sample-027767,then the thing came upon him in a flash
sample-027768,she told them to kidnap me

sample-027791,the boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid responding to her question
sample-027792,he stood irresolute for a moment and then scrambled out of the pit
sample-027793,never stop dreaming the old king had said
sample-027794,i need a drink

sample-027797,it was a cobra whose venom could kill a person in minutes
sample-027798,petrov made a funny face as he turned

sample-027825,i've already had that experience with my sheep and now it's happening with people
sample-027826,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
sample-027827,what is an alchemist he asked finally
sample-027828,i had seen all that it would presently bring me
sample-027829,and that's my farewell to the newspaper game
sample-027830,he sat on a stone and allowed himself to become hypnotized by the horizon
sample-027831,and then there were the others who were interested only in gold
sample-027832,what your husband was mixed up in
sample-027833,how much does this cost
sample-027834,we will have to run if we want to catch that bus
sample-027835,and better still to be alone with one's books
sample-027836,and it knew nothing about love
sample-027837,it sure looks good from here
sample-027838,what kind of blow should one deliver next in order to remain alive
sample-027839,but the englishman was exultant
sample-027840,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
sample-027841,after passing her final exam she will have a bachelor of science degree in chemistry
sample-027842,the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
sample-027843,maybe that's why they always stay close to me
sample-027844,if good things are coming they will be a pleasant surprise said the seer
sample-027845,he decided to return to his friend's stable by the longest route possible
sample-027846,didn't you hear him
sample-027847,having heard that the boy became even more interested in alchemy
sample-027850,my husband revealed he was homosexual

sample-027856,and you can meet us at the station
sample-027857,they went in to drink the tea which was served in beautiful crystal glasses
sample-027868,this is the first phase of the job he said
sample-027869,one afternoon one of his servants fell ill and it appeared that he would die
sample-027878,some of the grey ash was falling off the circular edge
sample-027879,he followed the movement of the birds trying to read something into it
sample-027880,i have the money i need to buy my sheep
sample-027881,down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
sample-027882,the alchemist dismounted and told the escorts they could return to the camp
sample-027883,the city was still sleeping
sample-027884,i'm afraid that if my dream is realized i'll have no reason to go on living
sample-027885,he was going to miss the place and all the good things he had learned
sample-027886,they started right in bribing me
sample-027887,scattered groups of people were hurrying from the direction of woking
sample-027890,i'm afraid it'll be steve tina
sample-027891,and at that i told him and he took my place

sample-027893,and that he a boy could perform miracles
sample-027894,he prepared himself a sandwich and drank some hot tea from a crystal glass
sample-027895,he had never imagined that questions about life would be of such importance to a shepherd
sample-027896,i find the other argument dubious
sample-027897,he noticed the unequal cooling of its surface
sample-027908,so you combined pleasure with business
sample-027909,the boy didn't say anything
sample-027918,the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees
sample-027919,it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
sample-027920,it was just right
sample-027921,they went out of business years ago
sample-027922,there was no response from the elders
sample-027923,formatting of tables should be improved
sample-027924,all things are one the boy thought

sample-027927,may i go in and see him
sample-027930,the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
sample-027931,and at that i told him and he took my place
sample-027932,but everything had changed
sample-027933,and i'd like to have it
sample-027934,i hope he grows up to look like you
sample-027935,he's probably trying the gate
sample-027936,looks like she can keep kathy's on her toes
sample-027937,that's why i feel that i deserve a part of what you find
sample-027940,what do you want
sample-027941,he was learning a lot of new things
sample-027942,they called that discovery the master work  it was part liquid and part solid
sample-027943,they're not concerned with that right now
sample-027944,sometimes there's just no way to hold back the river
sample-027945,when he had completed the cleaning he asked the man for something to eat
sample-027946,it must be some kind of a gag
sample-027947,henderson went into the railway station to telegraph the news to london

sample-027953,hundreds must have seen it and taken it for a falling star
sample-027954,that's what she said the last time
sample-027955,you should see the other guy specifically how good at fighting he is
sample-027956,some storms are worth the wreckage
sample-027957,you didn't have to do any cleaning he said
sample-027958,let's stop this another commander said
sample-027959,the boy observed in silence the progress of the animals and people across the desert
sample-027960,if you start your emails with greetings let me be the first to welcome you to earth
sample-027961,at once he connected the two incidents
sample-027962,the boy smiled and continued digging
sample-027963,the alchemist stopped abruptly and bent to the ground
sample-027964,i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
sample-027965,the cistern was malfunctioning
sample-027966,not everyone can see his dreams come true in the same way
sample-027967,you shouldn't be here the alchemist answered
sample-027968,but those who know about such things would know that those are urim and thummim
sample-027969,make you're a hero sure as you're born
sample-027970,the top of the cylinder was rotating on its body
sample-027971,you must not let up even after having come so far he continued

sample-027976,what'd you wish when you threw that rock
sample-027977,the boy was shocked
sample-027978,the old man wore a breastplate of heavy gold covered with precious stones
sample-027979,they mounted their horses
sample-027980,but you can't do that
sample-027981,spending time with each other can be more valuable than any material present
sample-027982,i'm going to guide you across the desert the alchemist said
sample-027983,and what a way to quit
sample-027984,vanessa cannot undo her mistake
sample-027985,maybe we're all that way the boy mused
sample-027986,the oxygen's only to help him till the doctor gets here

sample-027993,one of these days is tomorrow

sample-027997,the boy was becoming nervous
sample-027998,from the railway station in the distance came the sound of trains ringing and rumbling
sample-027999,the meeting was over
sample-028008,queuing is something the british excel at
sample-028009,yet it was a little too large for assurance
sample-028018,nobody's trying to put anything over on you
sample-028019,that was his work
sample-028020,he told fatima that at their next meeting
sample-028021,how do you know she didn't

sample-028037,mecca is a lot farther away than the pyramids
sample-028040,they whisked themselves into a frenzy
sample-028041,the garden is older than the house in fact
sample-028042,apple pie is an iconic dish
sample-028043,why do you want to find that sort of person the arab asked

sample-028045,the englishman was disappointed
sample-028046,you're the one who may die the alchemist said
sample-028047,i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
sample-028048,it's the oasis said the camel driver
sample-028049,one of the first problems you'll run into is recognition errors particularly with any command that allows raw dictation

sample-028054,hires two personal trainers and make one of them train the other one

sample-028063,in his hand he grasped a snake by the tail
sample-028064,the city was still sleeping
sample-028065,do you tell lies
sample-028066,we want some action in these pictures
sample-028067,they both spoke the same language
sample-028068,not with my money
sample-028069,the top had certainly ceased to rotate
sample-028070,the alchemists spent years in their laboratories observing the fire that purified the metals
sample-028071,it was a strange furnace fueled by firewood with a transparent flask heating on top
sample-028072,i thought that someday i'd be rich and could go to mecca
sample-028073,he ran his fingers slowly over the stones sensing their temperature and feeling their surfaces
sample-028074,the old man returned the book to the boy
sample-028075,if we serve tea in crystal the shop is going to expand
sample-028076,before the boy could reply a butterfly appeared and fluttered between him and the old man

sample-028080,he had seen the shooting star and was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere nearby
sample-028081,most of them were staring quietly at the big table
sample-028082,excuse you for what
sample-028083,on the second day the boy climbed to the top of a cliff near the camp
sample-028084,as the sun rose the men began to beat the boy
sample-028085,i said i wish i'd never been born
sample-028086,then she filled her vessel with water and left
sample-028087,he knew what i was thinking the boy said to himself
sample-028088,if a person is living out his destiny he knows everything he needs to know
sample-028089,he stuck his hand into the pouch and felt around for one of the stones
sample-028090,he thought of the woman who had trusted in the desert
sample-028091,they represent millions of voters
sample-028092,i heard what you were talking about the other day with the alchemist the wind said
sample-028093,i can interpret it but the interpretation is very difficult
sample-028094,it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience
sample-028095,must have been a kid
sample-028096,the thought was so dreadful to him that he forgot about the heat and went forward
sample-028097,he disappeared into the tent
sample-028098,the boy wanted to take her hand
sample-028099,i can't let her out

sample-028110,so you know about love the boy said
sample-028111,no one seemed to have thought about it that night
sample-028112,the shining gem was exhilarating to behold as it sparkled
sample-028113,don't you see what a wonderful thing this can be
sample-028114,the war continued and at times the wind carried the sweet sickly smell of blood
sample-028115,parachuting is dangerous
sample-028116,don't mind the colonel
sample-028117,maybe we're all that way the boy mused
sample-028118,i want to see him do it said the chief
sample-028119,they were looking only for gold his companion answered
sample-028120,i had a memo from art today
sample-028121,all that time the martians must have been getting ready
sample-028122,it's like the camel driver said 'eat when it's time to eat
sample-028123,he began to dig at the base of the sycamore
sample-028124,where was his horse
sample-028125,about eleven i walked back to my home in maybury because nothing seemed to be happening
sample-028126,some went away while i was there and other people came

sample-028131,it was a pleasant change from talking to his sheep
sample-028132,i like the way she talks
sample-028133,it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
sample-028134,he got up early with the idea of finding it
sample-028135,i'm getting trevor ready
sample-028136,when he was a child that man wanted to travel too
sample-028137,don't you know there are nine jobs waiting for this guy
sample-028138,see if you can get us seats near the umbrellas
sample-028139,i can clean up those glasses in the window if you want said the boy
sample-028140,and all's fair in love and war
sample-028141,the wind screamed with delight and blew harder than ever
sample-028142,they're not worth much the englishman answered
sample-028143,the boy felt ill and terribly alone
sample-028144,i am here the boy said
sample-028145,it seemed so safe and tranquil
sample-028146,the boy told him then that he needed to get to the pyramids
sample-028147,why don't you want me to see him
sample-028150,most meteorites are more or less rounded
sample-028151,their faces were hidden behind blue veils with only their eyes showing
sample-028152,you lived your life in a loving way and died with dignity
sample-028153,i use short madeup words to dictate common symbols
sample-028154,as soon as he saw me among the crowd he called to me to come down
sample-028155,it turned out to be a bitter tea
sample-028156,the boy saw a man appear behind the counter
sample-028157,at the highest point in tarifa there is an old fort built by the moors
sample-028168,he had seen kings and beggars walking the desert sands
sample-028169,this is the morning post you're talking to
sample-028178,june decided to retire
sample-028179,i need you to be spontaneous he asked me out to din din
sample-028180,and he told what he had seen
sample-028181,had our instruments permitted it we might have been able to see the trouble way back when
sample-028182,looking through the telescope i saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet
sample-028183,the alchemist dismounted and told the escorts they could return to the camp
sample-028184,from where i am the sun said i can see the soul of the world
sample-028185,well then why did you let me do it the boy asked
sample-028186,something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top
sample-028187,are you going to go to julia's
sample-028190,i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
sample-028191,but i haven't been able to do it
sample-028192,so they think she left it with you
sample-028193,lighthouses in a foggy world
sample-028194,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
sample-028195,the old woman had said the same thing
sample-028196,it was more activity than usual for this time of the morning
sample-028197,i tell you that it's no good
sample-028208,meanwhile the old man persisted in his attempt to strike up a conversation
sample-028209,you wanna take this outside
sample-028218,we know that and we are used to it
sample-028219,henderson went into the railway station to telegraph the news to london
sample-028220,we need to solve this problem fast
sample-028221,i have already found my treasure
sample-028222,storm increasing over the rockies
sample-028223,it was faintly marked with transverse stripes and slightly flattened from the perfect round
sample-028224,well i should think it was sudden
sample-028225,he took the fourth part and handed it to the monk
sample-028226,everything in the universe evolved he said
sample-028227,we'll be down with the bags in a minute
sample-028230,i think you're crazy
sample-028231,that night there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet
sample-028232,but you are in the desert
sample-028233,they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
sample-028234,it seemed such a little thing so bright and small and still
sample-028235,you've never been born
sample-028236,it's called the principle of favorability
sample-028237,he had found where his treasure was and was frightened at what might happen
sample-028240,some do come back
sample-028241,the top had certainly ceased to rotate
sample-028242,you old sorcerer the boy shouted up to the sky
sample-028243,the track pad on this laptop needs calibrating
sample-028244,why a revolver he asked
sample-028245,it brought his heart into his mouth
sample-028246,i didn't frisk him
sample-028247,it's not easy to find the philosopher's stone said the englishman
sample-028248,it didn't bring with it the smell of the desert nor the threat of moorish invasion
sample-028249,i don't blame him
sample-028250,it's the emerald tablet said the englishman proud that he might teach something to the boy
sample-028251,some of the grey ash was falling off the circular edge
sample-028252,you and i aren't like hassan that rich merchant
sample-028253,the level ground was blackened as far as one could see and it was still giving off smoke
sample-028254,it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-028255,because i don't live in either my past or my future
sample-028256,you mean you're not coming back to work here
sample-028257,the alchemist's words echoed out like a curse
sample-028259,an army is coming the boy said
sample-028260,no he heard a voice on the wind say
sample-028261,absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
sample-028262,throughout the entire day we will be on the lookout for our enemies
sample-028263,it was the old man who spoke first
sample-028265,he noticed the unequal cooling of its surface
sample-028266,close shot of the colonel
sample-028267,he just took over the bank
sample-028268,and a whole cold chicken staring us right in the face
sample-028269,dense clouds of smoke or dust can be seen through a powerful telescope
sample-028271,there's life here the boy said to the alchemist
sample-028272,susan wrapped each present individually
sample-028273,but you are in the desert
sample-028274,my wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red green and yellow signal lights
sample-028275,i still have no idea how to turn myself into the wind the boy repeated
sample-028276,and the girl pointed to the south indicating that it was there the strange man lived
sample-028277,we speak of them only to children
sample-028278,the alchemist opened a bottle and poured a red liquid into the boy's cup
sample-028279,he wanted to say so to the alchemist but he was afraid of the man
sample-028280,they opened the bottle of wine and drank heavily
sample-028281,and tell louie to stick around
sample-028282,the boy took them to the cliff where he had been on the previous day
sample-028283,who told you about omens the boy's interest was increasing by the moment
sample-028284,that wasn't at all necessary
sample-028285,you and i aren't like hassan that rich merchant
sample-028286,nature knows me as the wisest being in creation the sun said
sample-028287,i was wondering if you could tell me a bit more about what it's like to live and work there
sample-028288,a hundred nuns stampeded the vatican
sample-028289,something happens here you'll have to remember later on
sample-028290,let me tell you what will happen
sample-028291,i didn't have it
sample-028292,she may be lost
sample-028293,the boy closed his book
sample-028294,i'm leaving today said the boy
sample-028295,i can clean up those glasses in the window if you want said the boy
sample-028296,it's not a battle of good against evil
sample-028297,a boy came running towards me
sample-028298,the only tribesman spared was the commander of the battalion
sample-028299,he said that everything has its own destiny
sample-028300,it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-028301,i have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk which was embedded in the ground
sample-028302,no one seemed to have thought about it that night
sample-028303,and he decided he would go to see the chiefs of the tribes
sample-028304,the boy could certainly resist causing that kind of anxiety for the baker
sample-028305,the alchemist was a bit daunting but as the boy drank the wine he relaxed
sample-028306,then like a colony of worker ants they dismantled their stalls and left
sample-028307,but the merchant understood what the boy had said
sample-028308,what's wrong with that
sample-028309,he experienced the pictures with his fingers while he listened
sample-028310,what is my function
sample-028311,only in that way would he be able to read the omens
sample-028312,they began to ride out over the sands with the moon lighting their way
sample-028313,that sobered him a little
sample-028314,he was going to miss the place and all the good things he had learned
sample-028315,the war is going to end someday the girl said
sample-028316,it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
sample-028317,i don't know why
sample-028318,this banana tastes like cherries
sample-028319,to show you one of life's simple lessons the alchemist answered
sample-028320,my seven year resume gap is marked not drugs
sample-028321,no hope no adventure no old kings or destinies no treasure and no pyramids
sample-028322,there was a small building there with a window at which people bought tickets to africa
sample-028323,it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
sample-028324,i guess i used all the shells
sample-028325,didn't i tell you never to come panhandling around here
sample-028326,lots of shepherds passed through selling their wool
sample-028327,throughout the night the boy dug at the place he had chosen but found nothing
sample-028328,among these people were a couple of cyclists a gardener i employed sometimes and a girl carrying a baby
sample-028329,we speak of them only to children
sample-028330,my palms were sweaty and my mouth was dry it must be a phobia
sample-028331,he's already killed three men
sample-028332,take her to the hospital
sample-028333,it was just that he couldn't grasp what it meant
sample-028334,they opened the bottle of wine and drank heavily
sample-028335,the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
sample-028336,it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-028337,she spoke swedish he spoke spanish
sample-028338,the tired paramedic handed over his patient for surgery
sample-028339,one afternoon one of his servants fell ill and it appeared that he would die
sample-028340,the cottage burned down
sample-028341,how long is what
sample-028342,where are you from the boy asked
sample-028343,because he knew what he would find
sample-028344,i've never seen her before
sample-028345,it was about you
sample-028346,you have been a real blessing to me
sample-028347,he looked around at the empty plaza again feeling less desperate than before
sample-028350,even the guides spoke very little to one another
sample-028351,so immerse yourself in it
sample-028352,when you find a bug in software please report it
sample-028353,he's after the money
sample-028354,because you have already lost your savings twice
sample-028355,they stood there looking at the moon
sample-028356,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
sample-028357,the door was locked
sample-028368,i just know that the tradition is always right
sample-028369,looking down at the spoon he held the boy saw that the oil was gone
sample-028378,the last extension i rely on is keyboard shortcuts to reorder tabs
sample-028379,and maybe it wasn't that they were teaching me but that i was learning from them
sample-028380,alfayoum is in egypt said the arab
sample-028381,and i'd better read your books said the boy
sample-028382,many telescopes were pointed at it
sample-028383,so that those who have the responsibility for understanding can understand he said
sample-028384,he had been to the village only once the year before
sample-028385,i told you that your dream was a difficult one
sample-028386,when did you arrive in town
sample-028387,toward the end of the afternoon they came upon a coptic monastery
sample-028390,in order to find the treasure you will have to follow the omens
sample-028391,then leave with the caravan
sample-028392,they were looking only for gold his companion answered
sample-028393,and that he a boy could perform miracles
sample-028394,the boy watched the exchange with fascination
sample-028395,the boy reminded the old man that he had said something about hidden treasure
sample-028396,he couldn't have been wrong
sample-028397,all that time the martians must have been getting ready
sample-028408,now i too will be one of the women who wait
sample-028409,he had suddenly remembered that in tarifa there was an old woman who interpreted dreams
sample-028418,i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
sample-028419,it's crawling with cops outside
sample-028420,no one seemed to have thought about it that night
sample-028421,what's your name he asked
sample-028422,samantha's boots felt heavy and her chest was tightening
sample-028423,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
sample-028424,the boy listened quietly
sample-028425,he should respect tradition
sample-028426,we lit the lantern and walked over to his house
sample-028427,and so do you
sample-028430,he carried two dead hawks over his shoulder
sample-028431,your luck's not with you now
sample-028432,the horse reared again raising a cloud of dust
sample-028433,you'll get into a worse one if you don't
sample-028434,hires two personal trainers and make one of them train the other one
sample-028435,the man looked at him without responding
sample-028436,the reason for this is to discern your strengths
sample-028437,then he sat in the sunfilled doorway smoking the hookah
sample-028440,they were all furious when the escapade failed
sample-028441,before the boy could reply a butterfly appeared and fluttered between him and the old man
sample-028442,but they really don't know what they're saying
sample-028443,there were just drawings coded instructions and obscure texts
sample-028444,what did i tell you
sample-028445,the boy was relieved
sample-028446,as they stood on the escalator they wondered how high they were
sample-028447,sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
sample-028448,it seemed so safe and tranquil
sample-028449,get this car out of here
sample-028450,the man wept with happiness
sample-028451,i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
sample-028452,it was linda keller
sample-028453,sure you don't want me to go in with you
sample-028454,of course the two were unable to do anything
sample-028455,there's one that says 'everything that happens once can never happen again
sample-028456,what's my name doing on it
sample-028457,my tax dollars pay for those public school proms
sample-028458,come on with that money
sample-028459,he told fatima that at their next meeting
sample-028460,but the alchemist continued to look to the horizon
sample-028461,i've handled a good many big promotions in my time
sample-028462,aren't you allowed to kiss back
sample-028463,maybe tomorrow will be better than yesterday
sample-028464,one is loved because one is loved
sample-028465,it was my fear of failure that first kept me from attempting the master work
sample-028466,there are powerful forces on both sides and the war is important to both armies
sample-028467,he was selling better than ever
sample-028468,where's mrs luke's box of capsules
sample-028469,let me tell you what will happen
sample-028470,he wanted your money he said
sample-028471,the boy went to the well every day to meet with fatima
sample-028472,but they don't count
sample-028473,you can't believe it's not butter
sample-028474,i looked at the cylinder again and was completely terrified
sample-028475,never advertise razors by shaving a monkey it's cruel and results in lawsuits
sample-028476,there was absolutely no reason for her to announce it to the entire company
sample-028477,he decided to return to his friend's stable by the longest route possible
sample-028478,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
sample-028479,but he granted the travelers three days
sample-028480,help my son megan tonight
sample-028481,i wonder what's keeping mother
sample-028482,the reason for this is to discern your strengths
sample-028483,the whole town's in an uproar
sample-028484,i was wondering if you could tell me a bit more about what it's like to live and work there
sample-028485,the old man knew how to read and had already read the book
sample-028486,what does that get us
sample-028487,he sat on a stone and allowed himself to become hypnotized by the horizon
sample-028488,others stumbled upon the stone by accident
sample-028489,it's the name of the prophet's daughter fatima said
sample-028490,at once he connected the two incidents
sample-028491,not even the tribal chieftains are able to see him when they want to
sample-028492,i noticed that the boy answered
sample-028493,she spent almost all night finishing her thesis
sample-028494,the boy was embarrassed and confessed that he had observed nothing
sample-028495,it's not what enters men's mouths that's evil said the alchemist
sample-028496,i got the faculty all up out of bed
sample-028497,he followed the movement of the birds trying to read something into it
sample-028498,you knew the whole story
sample-028499,can you do your stuff
sample-028500,what do you know about that
sample-028501,i forgot you were here
sample-028503,what your husband was mixed up in
sample-028504,his way isn't the same as mine nor mine as his
sample-028505,a boy came running towards me
sample-028506,the horse reared again raising a cloud of dust
sample-028507,and it's not love to see everything from a distance like you do
sample-028508,lucy's a newspaper woman
sample-028509,i can't do that
sample-028510,i would bury it in the garden
sample-028511,can't you just observe men and omens in order to understand the language the boy asked
sample-028512,why did you want to see me the boy asked
sample-028513,then how do i know this is your office
sample-028514,that tina thought it was funny
sample-028515,from that day on it was the desert that would be important
sample-028517,those are the rules of war the leader explained
sample-028518,the vision vanished immediately but it had shaken him
sample-028519,but before i go i want to tell you a little story
sample-028520,maybe because that wasn't really his dream
sample-028521,who wrote that speech for you
sample-028522,the arab accepted them without a word
sample-028523,i myself heard nothing of that
sample-028524,i've got a weakness
sample-028525,this is why alchemy exists the boy said
sample-028526,better bring me a glass of milk
sample-028527,i thought that someday i'd be rich and could go to mecca
sample-028528,given only the public key it is very hard to compute the private one
sample-028529,i shall make us some ice cubes
sample-028530,my friend bought all the other sheep immediately
sample-028531,they inspected the menu at the restaurant
sample-028532,the hydrogen gas escaped
sample-028533,looking through the telescope i saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet
sample-028534,he had surprised himself with the thought
sample-028535,the night was warm and i was thirsty
sample-028536,you can't kid me
sample-028537,and above all don't forget to follow your destiny through to its conclusion
sample-028538,the greatest authority on meteorites stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles
sample-028539,i'm already used to the way things are
sample-028540,i'm never more aware of a room's acoustics than when i'm trying to enjoy a snack i have no intention of sharing
sample-028541,so they think she left it with you
sample-028542,you need to see this
sample-028543,what had been next to him five minutes ago was now at the other side
sample-028544,that's a good luck omen the englishman said after the fat arab had gone out
sample-028545,where is the treasure he asked
sample-028546,i could get a company doctor in twenty minutes
sample-028547,the englishman was disappointed
sample-028550,do you care if i sit down out here
sample-028551,he prepared himself a sandwich and drank some hot tea from a crystal glass
sample-028552,he disappeared into the tent
sample-028553,the linux terminal refuses to make me a cup of coffee
sample-028554,and one or two persons were returning
sample-028555,clinical studies of the new vaccine are still outstanding
sample-028556,i said i was trying to catch one
sample-028557,continue in the direction of the pyramids said the alchemist
sample-028568,life attracts life the alchemist answered
sample-028569,forget it there is no such thing
sample-028578,and it knew nothing about love
sample-028579,don't ask me how i know
sample-028580,no he heard a voice on the wind say
sample-028581,you can't talk to her like that though
sample-028582,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
sample-028583,most of them were staring quietly at the big table
sample-028584,i don't want to change anything because i don't know how to deal with change
sample-028585,the level ground was blackened as far as one could see and it was still giving off smoke
sample-028586,if it would save a woman's life
sample-028587,frank was dying so they were forced to leave him
sample-028590,my dream is to see a polar bear
sample-028591,i just want to dream about mecca
sample-028592,i don't care what happens to me
sample-028593,i'm going to become bitter and distrustful of people because one person betrayed me
sample-028594,we could get to the pyramids by tomorrow said the other taking the money
sample-028595,the next day the boy returned to the well hoping to see the girl
sample-028596,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
sample-028597,he thought it was normal to panic and to feel as though he really didnt deserve anything good or great
sample-028608,does a man's heart always help him the boy asked the alchemist
sample-028609,nope not going unless they have a giant inflatable slide
sample-028618,as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
sample-028619,i'd like to take a bath
sample-028620,i don't want anything else in life
sample-028621,there are some things a person just can't do
sample-028622,if you pay attention to the present you can improve upon it
sample-028623,that rollercoaster was insane
sample-028624,and he came down after the game with a contract
sample-028625,that sobered him a little
sample-028626,this horse has more than one horse power
sample-028627,it's a nasty day
sample-028630,where's mrs luke's box of capsules
sample-028631,but they were not there
sample-028632,the end of the cylinder was still as ogilvy and henderson had left it
sample-028633,his name was joseph
sample-028634,who is responsible for these parrots
sample-028635,but his heart was speaking of other things
sample-028636,i'm on the job
sample-028637,have you any idea what these things cost over here
sample-028640,tell her i elected her and i can have her impeached
sample-028641,he decanted the wine and began to recount the disturbing story he had been told
sample-028642,who told you that asked the boy startled
sample-028643,all that time the martians must have been getting ready
sample-028644,it required no explanation just as the universe needs none as it travels through endless time
sample-028645,i sold crystal and crossed the desert
sample-028646,imagine if everyone went around transforming lead into gold
sample-028647,i'd like to take a bath
sample-028648,the decision was already made
sample-028649,from here on you will be alone the alchemist said
sample-028650,you must not let up even after having come so far he continued
sample-028651,then he turned to the boy
sample-028652,because you are trying to realize your destiny
sample-028653,you said you wanted fireworks
sample-028654,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
sample-028655,he wanted to tell him about fatima
sample-028656,if what one finds is made of pure matter it will never spoil
sample-028657,two more months passed and the shelf brought many customers into the crystal shop
sample-028658,in a weeks time we're going to america
sample-028659,i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
sample-028660,the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
sample-028661,and yet none of these people has ever met the old king
sample-028662,the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
sample-028663,but that was simply because my eye was tired
sample-028664,the mixture took on a reddish color almost the color of blood
sample-028665,the camel driver was not a fighter and he had consulted with seers
sample-028666,noone knows what's behind this gate
sample-028667,on the third day the chief met with his officers
sample-028668,i'm going to hate those who have found their treasure because i never found mine
sample-028669,let's stop this another commander said
sample-028670,it has happened many times before
sample-028671,they were given to me as a present by a king the boy said
sample-028672,the burning fire had been extinguished
sample-028673,he told me i should try to do so
sample-028674,he's already got charge of the bank
sample-028675,you wanna take this outside
sample-028676,you've got the brain of a pancake
sample-028677,meanwhile the old man persisted in his attempt to strike up a conversation
sample-028678,strange images passed through my mind
sample-028679,all this happened between sunrise and sunset the boy thought
sample-028680,without such love one's dreams would have no meaning
sample-028681,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
sample-028682,and i'd better read your books said the boy
sample-028683,don't tell me you were worried
sample-028684,this requires a little thought here
sample-028685,what a load of trash sarah opined
sample-028686,but the boy was certain that he had been looking at them
sample-028687,where you got him
sample-028688,everybody wait a minute
sample-028689,people from all over the world have passed through this village son said his father
sample-028690,that's all i want to know
sample-028691,the wind approached the boy and touched his face
sample-028692,you left out number five
sample-028693,the desert fills men's hearts with visions the camel driver answered
sample-028694,i saw a young man standing on the cylinder and trying to scramble out of the hole again
sample-028695,are you going to let her out
sample-028696,there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
sample-028697,he paused and his eyes were still unfriendly
sample-028698,have you seen him yet
sample-028699,i told him that was what i had come here to learn
sample-028700,it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-028701,we've got to do something
sample-028702,but then he remembered that he wasn't going to have to pay anything
sample-028703,the streamer of gas came out towards us
sample-028704,i am here the boy said
sample-028705,i never even noticed she had one
sample-028706,the scottish parliament contains politicians
sample-028707,the boy didn't say anything
sample-028708,he spent the entire morning observing the infrequent comings and goings in the street
sample-028709,i like the way she talks
sample-028710,and maybe it wasn't that they were teaching me but that i was learning from them
sample-028711,let me tell you what will happen
sample-028712,this morning i found a calculator taped to my wii
sample-028713,mostly just the hearts of those who are trying to realize their destinies
sample-028714,what had been next to him five minutes ago was now at the other side
sample-028715,now listen to me
sample-028716,give them a little third degree
sample-028717,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
sample-028718,your method is systematic and mostly reasonably motivated
sample-028719,i'll phone them right away to get that story
sample-028720,at his side was the young arab the boy had spoken with earlier
sample-028721,the sword didn't fall
sample-028722,all the type  has been sent to salt lake
sample-028723,they didn't have the printing press in those days the boy argued
sample-028724,it seemed such a little thing so bright and small and still
sample-028725,henderson stood up with a spade in his hand
sample-028726,one that will write
sample-028727,artisanal gin bar seriously
sample-028728,about time one of you lunkheads said it
sample-028729,if good things are coming they will be a pleasant surprise said the seer
sample-028730,this is the power box we always have problems with if you could take a look
sample-028731,i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit
sample-028732,my mind ran on the possibilities of its content
sample-028733,the taylor jean movement isn't dead yet
sample-028734,you tell the police department to pick up eddie
sample-028735,sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
sample-028736,when you're at a party and somebody says banana bread a sniper might be near you
sample-028737,the boy took out urim and thummim from his bag
sample-028738,he doesn't have anything else
sample-028739,wouldn't do any good
sample-028740,then the two went off to have some more tea
sample-028741,as he was attempting to pull out the rocks he encountered he heard footsteps
sample-028742,eye trackers used to cost several thousand dollars but now you can grab a cheap one for less than a couple hundred bucks
sample-028743,from where he sat he could observe the plaza
sample-028744,as the astronaut walked into the translucent pod it transformed into an opaque material
sample-028745,no hope no adventure no old kings or destinies no treasure and no pyramids
sample-028746,all i saw was an army said the boy
sample-028747,some do come back
sample-028750,don't worry about that
sample-028751,but they don't count
sample-028752,oh they're laughing at me
sample-028753,at once he connected the two incidents
sample-028754,you don't deny that
sample-028755,for every ten dead men among our enemies you will receive a piece of gold
sample-028756,how much was it again
sample-028757,he's on the way
sample-028768,the camel driver was seated at the base of a palm tree observing the sunset
sample-028769,then i don't get paid
sample-028778,they were in an immense setting surrounded by thousands of people speaking a strange language
sample-028779,then taking his sheep he walked away
sample-028780,the streamer of gas came out towards us
sample-028781,and because the tribes declared war i went to the well seeking the alchemist
sample-028782,the stranger seemed satisfied with the answer
sample-028783,theres an artist on campus who makes some really cool drawings
sample-028784,the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees
sample-028785,the tea seemed less bitter
sample-028786,the newspaper articles had prepared everyone for the reception of the idea
sample-028787,that's when he caught your cold
sample-028790,i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
sample-028791,not everyone can see his dreams come true in the same way
sample-028792,it's not a battle of good against evil
sample-028793,from the railway station in the distance came the sound of trains ringing and rumbling
sample-028794,i promised that i would make my own decisions he said to himself
sample-028795,the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
sample-028796,because he was terrified the boy didn't answer
sample-028797,i'm going to them
sample-028800,the book that most interested the boy told the stories of the famous alchemists
sample-028801,who told you to do that
sample-028802,what do you want
sample-028803,a large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered
sample-028804,now im scared of what is inside of pies
sample-028805,the miner had abandoned everything to go mining for emeralds
sample-028806,my advice is duck and cross with your right
sample-028807,i taught them everything they do
sample-028810,as if i had the money back in a safe
sample-028811,before long maybe in just a few days he would be at the pyramids
sample-028812,my tax dollars pay for those public school proms
sample-028813,there's one that says 'everything that happens once can never happen again
sample-028814,most of them were staring quietly at the big table
sample-028815,but those who know about such things would know that those are urim and thummim
sample-028816,fatima was more important than his treasure
sample-028817,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
sample-028828,except for the dream
sample-028829,you already know all you need to know
sample-028838,it's extremely suspicious that there's no information about brains that didn't come from a brain
sample-028839,she had pneumonia once
sample-028840,i'm trying to explain to my mother how to get pictures off her phone
sample-028841,arabs often appeared in the city shopping and chanting their strange prayers several times a day
sample-028842,in those days very few of the people had any idea about astronomy
sample-028843,one night the father had a dream
sample-028844,i'm an alchemist simply because i'm an alchemist he said as he prepared the meal
sample-028845,he was about the same age and height as the boy
sample-028846,jupiter has a great red spot
sample-028847,the old woman had said the same thing
sample-028848,tangier is not like the rest of africa
sample-028849,from the railway station in the distance came the sound of trains ringing and rumbling
sample-028850,they represent millions of voters
sample-028851,the desert takes our men from us and they don't always return she said
sample-028852,down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
sample-028853,i'll return just as your father came back to your mother he said
sample-028854,the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
sample-028855,somewhere you are holding the person i love the boy said
sample-028856,my wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red green and yellow signal lights
sample-028857,we were awaiting the guitar player to begin the concert
sample-028858,everyone seemed very excited
sample-028859,back into the excavation
sample-028860,finally a young woman approached who was not dressed in black
sample-028861,i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
sample-028862,how do you think
sample-028863,i think it's about bird hunting but now i can see how that might be misinterpreted
sample-028864,at other times at a crucial moment i make it easier for things to happen
sample-028865,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
sample-028866,don't you remember the home i promised you
sample-028867,the land was ruined and i had to find some other way to earn a living
sample-028868,does a man's heart always help him the boy asked the alchemist
sample-028869,i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
sample-028870,these are days of sacrifice
sample-028871,it would have been visible to me had i only looked up as it passed
sample-028872,you guys wanna play some more poker
sample-028873,just by looking at them
sample-028874,i've been trying to figure it out
sample-028875,but he still couldn't flee
sample-028876,so now i fear nothing because it was those omens that brought you to me
sample-028877,he decided to concentrate on more practical matters
sample-028878,because he was terrified the boy didn't answer
sample-028879,why don't you shut up
sample-028880,lemme have the desk
sample-028881,among these people were a couple of cyclists a gardener i employed sometimes and a girl carrying a baby
sample-028882,glad he took the t out of that
sample-028883,but then i realized she couldn't have been
sample-028884,we have that all figured out
sample-028885,the fire alarm went off again but when i looked outside there was no one there
sample-028886,after the disclosure of the doping scandal the winner was deprived of the gold medal
sample-028887,did you actually give tamara that gun
sample-028888,my cat laid there soaking up the sunlight
sample-028889,they reached the center of a large plaza where the market was held
sample-028890,i'm not hiding anything the boy answered
sample-028891,she and her friends are always up against systems of control
sample-028892,my wheel rims are made of chrome
sample-028893,because he knew what he would find
sample-028894,but it is not a class that was requested by our alumni or prospective students
sample-028895,now get right up on the seat there
sample-028896,i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
sample-028897,this pepperoni tastes off she said
sample-028898,except for the dream
sample-028899,the stranger seemed satisfied with the answer
sample-028900,the scottish parliament contains politicians
sample-028901,i wanted them to be a part of your inheritance
sample-028902,the desert didn't answer him for a few moments
sample-028903,you don't have to sign anything
sample-028904,i would have won the junior olympics if not for those medaling kids
sample-028905,your son went to serve at a distant place and became a centurion
sample-028906,the night was warm and i was thirsty
sample-028907,with all of it
sample-028908,the visual acuity is astonishing
sample-028909,sometimes their caravan met with another
sample-028910,a monk dressed in black came to the gates
sample-028911,the internet of uncontrolled things brought us a distributed denial of service attack once again
sample-028912,a boy came running towards me
sample-028913,their horses cried out and all their weapons were filled with sand
sample-028914,it brought his heart into his mouth
sample-028915,a lot of money
sample-028916,what's the idea here
sample-028917,if i'm on the march i just concentrate on marching
sample-028918,i just want to dream about mecca
sample-028919,i don't know how to turn them into reality
sample-028920,among these people were a couple of cyclists a gardener i employed sometimes and a girl carrying a baby
sample-028921,come here a minute
sample-028922,hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after
sample-028923,i want them both arrested
sample-028924,the little group of people from the city dispersed
sample-028925,show me some gratitude
sample-028926,there were really i think two or three hundred people elbowing one another
sample-028927,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
sample-028928,he felt uneasy at the man's presence
sample-028929,it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
sample-028930,the boy didn't say anything
sample-028931,he walked slowly through the market
sample-028932,toward the end of the afternoon they came upon a coptic monastery
sample-028933,and yet none of these people has ever met the old king
sample-028934,at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars
sample-028935,and find out where the nearest telegraph office is
sample-028936,might as well be living in a refrigerator
sample-028937,he suggested that the boy look around the palace and return in two hours
sample-028938,i swear it on my mother's grave
sample-028939,i'd like to do that
sample-028948,i'll work all night until dawn and i'll clean every piece of crystal in your shop
sample-028949,that's true the boy thought
sample-028958,anthony kept himself busy by counting pigeons
sample-028959,he listened to the wind and felt the stones beneath his feet
sample-028960,the old man returned the book to the boy
sample-028961,someone set fire to the trash
sample-028962,he disappeared into the tent
sample-028963,i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
sample-028964,don't tell me you were worried
sample-028965,when does our plane take off again
sample-028966,they didn't have the printing press in those days the boy argued
sample-028967,the boy went to his room and packed his belongings
sample-028970,and did you put the envelope in your pocket
sample-028971,didn't you hear him
sample-028972,i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
sample-028973,i'm city editor in name only
sample-028974,just teach me to be the wind for a few moments the boy said
sample-028975,this is for the boy
sample-028976,what's she up to
sample-028977,and a guy named jefferson phillip
sample-028988,does that imply i can no longer play badminton
sample-028989,look at those shoulders
sample-028998,the boy listened quietly
sample-028999,what are they gonna think about you
sample-029000,they blow across the world without a birthplace and with no place to die
sample-029001,he knew how to shear them and how to slaughter them
sample-029002,the three fell silent
sample-029003,the boy didn't know what to say
sample-029004,the night was warm and i was thirsty
sample-029005,my review of the sun one star
sample-029006,i have clearly been discriminated because of my sex the feminist complained
sample-029007,the tradition teaches men how to cross the desert and how their children should marry
sample-029008,you're here rather early
sample-029009,it was the first time she had done that
sample-029010,then it became a signal of danger
sample-029011,he wants to get jill started in the research business
sample-029012,he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
sample-029013,for task switching in particular though i don't use the builtin commands
sample-029014,the future has never been so bright than today
sample-029015,i phoned but nobody answered
sample-029016,we've still got two bucks left
sample-029017,my mind ran on the possibilities of its content
sample-029018,they blow across the world without a birthplace and with no place to die
sample-029019,which view would you like
sample-029020,i'm an old superstitious arab and i believe in our proverbs
sample-029021,no he heard a voice on the wind say
sample-029022,curse the moment i met that old man he thought
sample-029023,what had been next to him five minutes ago was now at the other side
sample-029024,he approached the mass and was surprised at the size and the shape
sample-029025,we speak of them only to children
sample-029026,he moved about invisible but everyone could hear him
sample-029027,just a memory right now it signified shade water and a refuge from the war
sample-029028,i got a lot on my mind
sample-029029,it would be ideal if the wifi were gratis
sample-029030,but he had to move on
sample-029031,but you can't do that
sample-029032,all that time the martians must have been getting ready
sample-029033,fatima appeared at the entrance to the tent
sample-029034,i'll give you three minutes to tell me where she is
sample-029035,i just don't trust anyone who says they've never had hamburger helper
sample-029036,must have been that jump in the cold water
sample-029037,the boy was surprised at his thoughts
sample-029038,there's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around
sample-029039,the desert fills men's hearts with visions the camel driver answered
sample-029048,he knew he was stronger than his friend
sample-029049,and the names of the people involved were very difficult to pronounce
sample-029058,he's pretty young for that job
sample-029059,there was a time when for me a camel's whinnying was nothing more than whinnying
sample-029060,an old man with a breastplate of gold wouldn't have lied just to acquire six sheep
sample-029061,this parking space is for customers only
sample-029062,below is a letter which reached my desk this morning
sample-029063,he really was a king
sample-029064,you've got everything all set
sample-029065,on the very first page it described a burial ceremony
sample-029066,he had always believed that the sheep were able to understand what he said
sample-029067,why you lied to me
sample-029070,nope not going unless they have a giant inflatable slide
sample-029071,everything in the universe evolved he said
sample-029072,have you no idea who could have done it
sample-029073,you don't have to be rich skinny popular or even own a cape to perform a random act of kindness
sample-029074,everyone when they are young knows what their destiny is
sample-029075,the next day the boy returned to the well hoping to see the girl
sample-029076,so they think she left it with you
sample-029077,maybe he'll give us one
sample-029088,at the camp it was difficult to see anything
sample-029089,and because the tribes declared war i went to the well seeking the alchemist
sample-029098,give five points to the good daughter book
sample-029099,the boy knew a lot of people in the city
sample-029100,why don't you try johns hopkins in baltimore
sample-029101,inverse kinematics are a mathematical challenge for robot engineers
sample-029102,he picked up the two stones and put them back in his pouch
sample-029103,and at that i told him and he took my place
sample-029104,it was shredded like lace after an attack from hyperactive kittens
sample-029105,i've just sworn in four hundred deputies
sample-029106,here i am between my flock and my treasure the boy thought
sample-029107,the boy approached her to ask about the alchemist
sample-029110,because the crystal was dirty
sample-029111,because you'll know its dreams and wishes and will know how to deal with them
sample-029112,i think i got a date
sample-029113,and you ought to read more about the world answered the englishman
sample-029114,they set off running wildly into the trees
sample-029115,that's the reason why i came in fourth
sample-029116,i've been to your house a hundred times
sample-029117,the land was ruined and i had to find some other way to earn a living
sample-029128,congressman aaron is here to see you
sample-029129,they were inspired by that disaster to never let it happen again
sample-029138,at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars
sample-029139,there was a murmur from the crowd
sample-029140,i lost my wallet
sample-029141,he suddenly felt tremendously happy
sample-029142,we're just travelers the alchemist answered
sample-029143,he put a sign on the door and they went to a small cafe nearby
sample-029144,the hand that evokes love and creates a twin soul for every person in the world
sample-029145,well usually i learn more from my sheep than from books he answered
sample-029147,you've only had five meals today
sample-029148,men have never understood the words of the wise
sample-029149,you must love the desert but never trust it completely
sample-029150,a comet came within miles of the earth it almost obliterated the moon
sample-029151,they were fascinating stories each of them lived out his destiny to the end
sample-029153,mary told me that she got to meet up with you while she was back in san francisco
sample-029154,well then we've got a problem
sample-029155,fifty bucks ain't going to ruin me
sample-029156,he thought of all the married shepherds he had known
sample-029157,has melanie scott been in the papers
sample-029158,i have the diet of a kid who found twenty dollars
sample-029159,go down to the office and arrange for some radio time
sample-029160,as they watched the waves crashing into each other alice thought of home
sample-029161,studying these key phrases will help you while traveling
sample-029162,an alchemist said the alchemist
sample-029163,his soul must be too primitive to understand those things he thought
sample-029164,the old man knew how to read and had already read the book
sample-029165,who's the ten for
sample-029166,i can always go back to being a shepherd the boy thought
sample-029167,vibrations of peace throughout the tent
sample-029168,the boy turned to the hand that wrote all
sample-029169,the alchemist is two hundred years old the englishman had told him
sample-029170,there were raised voicesand some sort of struggle appeared to be going on 
sample-029171,the caravan moved toward the east
sample-029172,everyone should have health insurance
sample-029173,why should i be in any danger
sample-029174,so what do you want of me the sun asked
sample-029175,even though the sheep didn't teach me to speak arabic
sample-029176,it's coming right over
sample-029177,seems like yesterday to me
sample-029178,look at those shoulders
sample-029179,suddenly he disappeared and i could hear a faint shriek behind the walls
sample-029180,but arms cannot be drawn unless they also go into battle
sample-029181,it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience
sample-029182,love is the force that transforms and improves the soul of the world
sample-029183,the heather was on fire and you could see a thin blue smoke rising up slowly
sample-029184,the caravan began to travel day and night
sample-029186,i'm going to them
sample-029187,he was already re accustomed to desert's silence
sample-029188,and it's not love to see everything from a distance like you do
sample-029189,the whole creature heaved and pulsated convulsively
sample-029190,but if you can try to make your own decisions
sample-029192,you weren't here to build them
sample-029193,sorry to keep you waiting
sample-029194,how about that favor
sample-029195,the camel driver was not a fighter and he had consulted with seers
sample-029196,but the alchemist continued to look to the horizon
sample-029197,the englishman vanished too gone to find the alchemist
sample-029198,the criminals taunted the police officers and prison guards
sample-029199,be sure you soap his head thoroughly
sample-029200,may i see it
sample-029201,he got up early with the idea of finding it
sample-029202,i just know that the tradition is always right
sample-029203,he took out one of the stones
sample-029204,he just got a new kite for his birthday
sample-029205,they're just a pile of stones
sample-029206,find the schedule for a kiss before dying
sample-029207,did you want to see me
sample-029208,even the guides spoke very little to one another
sample-029209,but she said nothing
sample-029210,now i can see that it hasn't been too bad
sample-029211,then the thing came upon him in a flash
sample-029212,the meeting was over
sample-029213,he decided to return to his friend's stable by the longest route possible
sample-029214,but he still couldn't flee
sample-029215,i'm a woman of the desert she said averting her face
sample-029216,we must be good
sample-029217,why did you want to see me the boy asked
sample-029218,i know he wrote them on account of the misspellings
sample-029219,just as your grandfather taught you
sample-029220,i can learn something from the desert too
sample-029221,but don't let that out of your sight
sample-029222,too much food is being wasted
sample-029223,at the highest point in tarifa there is an old fort built by the moors
sample-029224,i'm playing for keeps
sample-029225,because my eyes are not yet accustomed to the desert the boy said
sample-029226,my leg's going to sleep
sample-029227,i still have no idea how to turn myself into the wind the boy repeated
sample-029228,i had the everyone has gary busey's teeth dream again
sample-029229,there were really i think two or three hundred people elbowing one another
sample-029230,so how will we name all these hurricanes
sample-029231,what are you afraid of melissa
sample-029232,the whole police force standing on it's ear
sample-029233,it's extremely suspicious that there's no information about brains that didn't come from a brain
sample-029234,i'm going to guide you across the desert the alchemist said
sample-029235,at once he connected the two incidents
sample-029236,i was scared but wasted no time in going out and crossing the bridge to the sand pits
sample-029237,he condemned the commander to death without honor
sample-029238,how do you mean
sample-029239,meanwhile the old man persisted in his attempt to strike up a conversation
sample-029248,an army is coming the boy said
sample-029249,the boy didn't say anything
sample-029258,i would have won the junior olympics if not for those medaling kids
sample-029259,when were these books written the boy asked
sample-029260,what was spoken was totally disregarded
sample-029261,strange images passed through my mind
sample-029262,because he's wearing moccasins
sample-029263,frank was dying so they were forced to leave him
sample-029264,it always helps to be learning something new and exciting
sample-029265,your husband must have been in a great hurry
sample-029266,don't you remember the home i promised you
sample-029267,and in that mood he was grateful to be in love
sample-029270,tangier is not like the rest of africa
sample-029271,do it for the paper
sample-029272,well interpret the dream he said
sample-029273,the night was warm and i was thirsty
sample-029274,as soon as he saw me among the crowd he called to me to come down
sample-029275,disregard my last statement
sample-029276,i know its dimensions and how it behaves
sample-029277,love is the force that transforms and improves the soul of the world
sample-029288,i'm looking forward to having more stability in my position and being done with the whole process
sample-029289,read all about it
sample-029298,the dead soldiers were replaced by others and life went on
sample-029299,it sounded like a gypsy prayer
sample-029300,there were raised voicesand some sort of struggle appeared to be going on 
sample-029301,and better still to be alone with one's books
sample-029302,some of the grey ash was falling off the circular edge
sample-029303,they began to ride out over the sands with the moon lighting their way
sample-029304,it's the oasis said the camel driver
sample-029305,at once he connected the two incidents
sample-029306,what we need is fireworks
sample-029307,the old man opened his cape and the boy was struck by what he saw
sample-029310,maybe he should not call people names that they don't want to be called
sample-029311,and that's where the power of love comes in
sample-029312,something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top
sample-029313,before the boy could reply a butterfly appeared and fluttered between him and the old man
sample-029314,he was alarmed by what had happened
sample-029315,to find out the exact threshold we need to repeat this in a reproducible manner
sample-029316,so what do you want of me the sun asked
sample-029317,a large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered
sample-029328,a boy came running towards me
sample-029329,younger man what he had seen and the man asked him to wait there
sample-029338,don't worry about that
sample-029339,aiding an escaped criminal
sample-029340,and then he would ask us to go back to our easels and replicate all the techniques in one go
sample-029341,i'd like to join but nobody asked me
sample-029342,in his hand he grasped a snake by the tail
sample-029343,the requirements are rather high for this job
sample-029344,then she took both of his hands in hers and began quietly to pray
sample-029345,mostly just the hearts of those who are trying to realize their destinies
sample-029346,others stumbled upon the stone by accident
sample-029347,the computer artist waited for the latest image to render
sample-029348,don't you see what's happening
sample-029349,he had come to the town only to find a woman who could interpret his dream
sample-029350,about eleven i walked back to my home in maybury because nothing seemed to be happening
sample-029351,what's done is done
sample-029352,the sticker was peeling from the item
sample-029353,and then they want the person to change
sample-029354,curse the moment i met that old man he thought
sample-029355,i'm going to go back to doing just what i did before the boy thought
sample-029356,i'll be back the boy said
sample-029357,you know how dreams are
sample-029358,the alchemist's words echoed out like a curse
sample-029359,i know it's soon to talk about it
sample-029360,tell me more about your dream said the woman
sample-029361,the old man looked disappointed
sample-029362,the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
sample-029363,all things are one the old man had said
sample-029364,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
sample-029365,it's the only one they had left
sample-029366,from there he could see africa in the distance
sample-029367,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
sample-029368,next time we are going to do it differently
sample-029369,there's gold here he said
sample-029370,learn to recognize omens and follow them the old king had said

sample-029381,the merchant turned to a customer who wanted three crystal glasses
sample-029382,he should have decided to become a shepherd the boy said
sample-029383,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
sample-029384,he knew nothing about the customs of the strange land he was in
sample-029385,elizabeth charles is dead
sample-029386,he moved about invisible but everyone could hear him
sample-029387,you had me worried
sample-029388,we got orders to hold you safely in the branches of this pine tree
sample-029389,but i'm going to egypt the boy said
sample-029390,i don't know how to find life in the desert the boy said
sample-029391,that's the way it always is said the old man
sample-029392,all this happened between sunrise and sunset the boy thought
sample-029393,sometimes there's just no way to hold back the river
sample-029394,it was glaringly hot not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind
sample-029395,the boy fell to the sand nearly unconscious
sample-029396,the man was speaking the language of alchemy
sample-029397,when you are loved you can do anything in creation
sample-029398,the boy went to look for the englishman
sample-029399,we've got to walk up to the tower
sample-029400,but that was simply because my eye was tired
sample-029401,ask the owner of that stall how much the sword costs he said to his friend
sample-029402,this log cabin is so quaint
sample-029403,he had assumed he would soon return to his sheep
sample-029404,he placed urim and thummim in the chest
sample-029405,now what are you going to do
sample-029406,when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
sample-029407,his hands were abraded and exhausted but he listened to his heart
sample-029408,they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
sample-029409,i'm talking about the building and loan
sample-029410,how would you like to work for me
sample-029411,i didn't want to marry anybody else in town
sample-029412,before him was an enormous white horse rearing over him with a frightening scream
sample-029413,the boy put the stones in his pouch
sample-029414,she used her microscope to inspect it
sample-029415,it had told him to dig where his tears fell
sample-029416,ten minutes ago i had a job
sample-029417,chickens lay so many eggs a week it wouldn't be possible to breed them all
sample-029418,the top of the cylinder was rotating on its body
sample-029419,rest well tonight as if you were a warrior preparing for combat
sample-029420,an ultimatum from edward and this one's final
sample-029421,they shouted consolation and promises and went off back to the town again to get help
sample-029422,let's the alchemist answered
sample-029423,i'd like to think
sample-029424,but i'm so awkward at parties
sample-029425,then we can climb mt helen
sample-029426,they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
sample-029427,if that guy lays an egg
sample-029428,you gave them everything i had the boy said
sample-029429,the boy spent a sleepless night
sample-029430,this will help you effectively collaborate with developers and coordinate crossteam projects throughout your career
sample-029431,read all about it
sample-029432,at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
sample-029433,he had seen the shooting star and was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere nearby
sample-029434,it's the emerald tablet said the englishman proud that he might teach something to the boy
sample-029435,i've already had that experience with my sheep and now it's happening with people
sample-029436,it's in all the afternoon papers
sample-029437,advancing slowly they searched among the stones
sample-029438,i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit
sample-029439,everyone seemed very excited
sample-029448,when i returned to the common the sun was setting
sample-029449,the war is going to end someday the girl said
sample-029458,in saudi arabia water is more expensive than oil
sample-029459,but there were certain of them who took a bit longer to awaken
sample-029460,at the first glance it was really not very exciting
sample-029461,that's the magic of omens said the boy
sample-029462,it must have fallen while i was sitting over there
sample-029463,you and i aren't like hassan that rich merchant
sample-029464,everything in life is an omen said the englishman now closing the journal he was reading
sample-029465,let's get out of here said the new arrival
sample-029466,taking the jacket out he began to clean the glasses
sample-029467,i haven't any hard feelings
sample-029470,he also tried to remember some good stories to relate as he sheared the sheep
sample-029471,an huge hole had been made by the impact of the projectile
sample-029472,she'll see us through dinner
sample-029473,still after that first million before you're thirty
sample-029474,you're looking for witch doctors he spoke some verses from the koran and moved on
sample-029475,enough said the boy
sample-029476,to continue his search for the treasure meant that he had to abandon fatima
sample-029477,i heard a faint movement under my feet
sample-029488,he's after the money
sample-029489,see if we can move it
sample-029498,his heart was heavy and he had been melancholy since the previous night
sample-029499,he disappeared into the tent
sample-029500,to keep on pitching
sample-029501,the heat lasted until nightfall and all that time he had to carry his jacket
sample-029502,at his side was the young arab the boy had spoken with earlier
sample-029503,you were seen at the enemy camp three days ago
sample-029504,scattered groups of people were hurrying from the direction of woking
sample-029505,it was a pleasant change from talking to his sheep
sample-029506,what he said reminded the boy of the old king
sample-029507,my review of the sun one star
sample-029510,i think i sprained my pride
sample-029511,one by one the campfires were extinguished and the oasis fell as quiet as the desert
sample-029512,but we could sell tea in crystal glasses
sample-029513,the omens had told him so
sample-029514,it was dropping off in flakes and raining down on the sand
sample-029515,jim became head of the draft board
sample-029516,only get me back to my husband and kids
sample-029517,welcome to dave's guitar session
sample-029528,i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
sample-029529,let's go hiking across france
sample-029538,the top had certainly ceased to rotate
sample-029539,but the boy never took his eye off his new friend
sample-029540,they called it the simum and it was worse than a storm at sea
sample-029541,i'll be back the boy said
sample-029542,he said to float away to happy land on the bubbles
sample-029543,this was my destiny not yours the alchemist answered
sample-029544,they were strange books
sample-029545,yet it was a little too large for assurance
sample-029546,this is the first phase of the job he said
sample-029547,to continue his search for the treasure meant that he had to abandon fatima
sample-029548,on the first day he returned with a rabbit and on the second with two birds
sample-029549,i'm going to take over a lot of plates and things
sample-029550,they forgot that lead copper and iron have their own destinies to fulfill
sample-029551,as they moved along the boy tried to listen to his heart
sample-029552,and they attacked an empty tent
sample-029553,all of the resources were used up
sample-029554,happy to know you
sample-029555,because you will never again be able to keep it quiet
sample-029556,my wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red green and yellow signal lights

sample-029559,fatima appeared at the entrance to the tent
sample-029560,when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
sample-029561,and then he would ask us to go back to our easels and replicate all the techniques in one go
sample-029562,when does our plane take off again
sample-029563,the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
sample-029564,the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
sample-029565,the young arab took out a book and began to read
sample-029566,looking down at the spoon he held the boy saw that the oil was gone
sample-029567,the boy's heart began to speak of fear
sample-029568,but you are in the desert
sample-029569,i have the diet of a kid who found twenty dollars
sample-029570,hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after

sample-029572,say something else
sample-029573,he didn't need to demonstrate his science and art to anyone
sample-029574,so what do you want of me the sun asked
sample-029575,then he turned to the boy
sample-029576,he felt weighted down by the centuries of time since the pyramids had been built
sample-029577,the sheep had taught him that
sample-029578,the level ground was blackened as far as one could see and it was still giving off smoke
