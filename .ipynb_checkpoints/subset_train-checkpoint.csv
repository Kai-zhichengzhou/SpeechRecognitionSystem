sample-000067,if a person is living out his destiny he knows everything he needs to know
sample-000068,the flock of flamingos landed gracefully on their awkward looking legs
sample-000069,the boy was sad as he left her that day
sample-000070,she went over to the hospital to call on professor davis
sample-000071,they were fascinating stories each of them lived out his destiny to the end
sample-000072,the charcoal burned away to white ash
sample-000073,the greatest authority on meteorites stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles
sample-000074,what if you can't stand him
sample-000075,i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
sample-000076,he didn't need to demonstrate his science and art to anyone
sample-000077,it was faintly marked with transverse stripes and slightly flattened from the perfect round
sample-000078,but you don't know about love
sample-000079,but then he remembered that he wasn't going to have to pay anything
sample-000080,why do you want to find that sort of person the arab asked
sample-000081,the shop is exactly the size i always wanted it to be
sample-000082,how do you handle the negative weights

sample-000086,his hands were abraded and exhausted but he listened to his heart
sample-000087,the alchemist followed as the boy's horse ran for almost half an hour
sample-000088,all this happened between sunrise and sunset the boy thought
sample-000089,shall i put a little rum in the coffee
sample-000090,to nourish the falcon
sample-000091,show me where there is life out in the desert
sample-000092,who is this stranger who speaks of omens asked one of the chieftains eyeing the boy
sample-000093,help my friend mr richard
sample-000094,want to walk to new york
sample-000095,dense clouds of smoke or dust can be seen through a powerful telescope
sample-000096,i didn't fall in

sample-000098,i only interpret dreams
sample-000099,the boss sent me over with it
sample-000100,half an hour later his shovel hit something solid
sample-000101,the fumes from the traffic was unbearable
sample-000102,about eleven i walked back to my home in maybury because nothing seemed to be happening
sample-000103,the level ground was blackened as far as one could see and it was still giving off smoke
sample-000104,but he decided to take a chance
sample-000105,it was immediately apparent
sample-000106,i don't understand what you're talking about the desert said
sample-000107,the englishman had several suitcases filled with books
sample-000108,he sat on a stone and allowed himself to become hypnotized by the horizon
sample-000109,it is i the boy answered
sample-000110,wish i had a million dollars
sample-000111,he still calls his mother 'mummy'
sample-000112,it's common to run into problems so read the instructions carefully
sample-000113,just handling them made him feel better
sample-000114,the boy noticed that the owner of the bar stood nearby listening attentively to their conversation
sample-000115,harry'll tear his dinner suit
sample-000116,sometime during the second year you'll remember about the treasure
sample-000117,you've got his gun
sample-000118,his hands were abraded and exhausted but he listened to his heart
sample-000119,it's not cheap but it matters a lot
sample-000120,we must be good
sample-000121,watch over her tonight
sample-000122,don't give in to your fears said the alchemist in a strangely gentle voice
sample-000123,there's a moon out tonight
sample-000124,the boy repeated his question
sample-000125,revenge is not my style but obviously accidents will happen
sample-000126,you're a week late for school already
sample-000127,you wanna take this outside
sample-000128,you have told me about your dreams about the old king and your treasure
sample-000129,but the boy was quiet
sample-000130,revenge is not my style but obviously accidents will happen
sample-000131,the levanter increased in intensity
sample-000132,with the girl with the raven hair his days would never be the same again
sample-000133,he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
sample-000134,wear the blue one
sample-000135,like crickets and like expectations like lizards and fourleaf clovers
sample-000136,i guess you're right
sample-000137,i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
sample-000138,there was very little talking
sample-000139,the two walked out among the palms
sample-000140,he had been so far away that his face wasn't even visible
sample-000141,they formed heaps that are visible a mile and a half away
sample-000142,men have never understood the words of the wise
sample-000143,hundreds must have seen it and taken it for a falling star
sample-000144,'m all about those invisible cosmic connections that transcend time and distance
sample-000145,get the bulletin board
sample-000146,they were strange books
sample-000147,you told me that
sample-000150,two days later the merchant spoke to the boy about the display
sample-000151,i never stole a watch in my life
sample-000152,good luck to you
sample-000153,maybe tomorrow said the boy moving away
sample-000154,i was just asking
sample-000155,let him have everything he wants
sample-000156,the following night the boy appeared at the alchemist's tent with a horse
sample-000157,one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
sample-000168,the alarm clock was set for twenty past three
sample-000169,most of them were staring quietly at the big table
sample-000178,then leave with the caravan
sample-000179,he is going to transform himself into the wind just to demonstrate his powers
sample-000180,you're still a good reporter
sample-000181,show me where there is life out in the desert
sample-000182,there isn't any more wine
sample-000183,does this belong to you
sample-000184,the boy was shocked
sample-000185,they wanted to save the oasis
sample-000186,two horsemen waiting ahead of them
sample-000187,i never said i'd take it
sample-000190,suddenly he disappeared and i could hear a faint shriek behind the walls
sample-000191,don't argue with me here
sample-000192,he's in my room
sample-000193,is she as good as you say
sample-000194,they filled three sacks
sample-000195,ogilvy watched till one and then gave up
sample-000196,this is the morning post you're talking to
sample-000197,you will spend that hour getting acquainted with marshall bailey
sample-000208,two days later the merchant spoke to the boy about the display
sample-000209,his arm seemed to be battling with whatever was in the hole
sample-000218,the display was underwhelming
sample-000219,now i want to ask you fellows a couple of questions
sample-000220,none of what the old man was saying made much sense to the boy
sample-000221,the strange horseman drew an enormous curved sword from a scabbard mounted on his saddle
sample-000222,i'm gonna build air fields
sample-000223,how could you even think that
sample-000224,a pox upon me for a clumsy thing
sample-000225,stove's hotter than i thought
sample-000226,don't argue with me here
sample-000227,there was nothing to hold him back except himself
sample-000230,this was the strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space
sample-000231,i can clean up those glasses in the window if you want said the boy
sample-000232,the wireless joypad was experiencing connection issues
sample-000233,after all who doesnt want to overcome new challenges and achieve great heights
sample-000234,does a man's heart always help him the boy asked the alchemist
sample-000235,it's like the camel driver said 'eat when it's time to eat
sample-000236,lucy's a newspaper woman
sample-000237,that's why all children should be nice
sample-000240,the shop was busy and the man asked the shepherd to wait until the afternoon
sample-000241,scattered groups of people were hurrying from the direction of woking
sample-000242,tonight they would find out the truth
sample-000243,mostly just the hearts of those who are trying to realize their destinies
sample-000244,that sobered him a little
sample-000245,show me where there is life out in the desert
sample-000246,he had assumed he would soon return to his sheep
sample-000247,it was however still so hot from its flight through the air
sample-000248,no the alchemist answered
sample-000249,we don't know what's in the confounded thing do you
sample-000250,how much is it worth
sample-000251,i found these one day in the fields
sample-000252,this is a common misconception sheldon said
sample-000253,i don't know what she's talking about
sample-000254,it all happened rather suddenly
sample-000255,sure see you there
sample-000256,they set off running wildly into the trees
sample-000257,a lot of these people are out of work
sample-000258,he noticed the unequal cooling of its surface
sample-000260,maybe we'd better ask someone the boy suggested
sample-000261,patrick has terminal cancer
sample-000262,this is jon davis
sample-000263,the world speaks many languages the boy thought
sample-000264,one afternoon one of his servants fell ill and it appeared that he would die
sample-000266,but you are forcing me to look at wealth and at horizons i have never known
sample-000267,they erased all evidence of their crimes
sample-000268,he paid for the wool and asked the shepherd to come back the following year
sample-000269,the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
sample-000270,and it's not love to see everything from a distance like you do
sample-000272,the boy continued to listen to his heart as they crossed the desert
sample-000273,i wish you wouldn't
sample-000274,i was wondering if you could tell me a bit more about what it's like to live and work there
sample-000275,my friend bought all the other sheep immediately
sample-000276,arabs often appeared in the city shopping and chanting their strange prayers several times a day
sample-000277,there is a reptile in my western shoes
sample-000278,how are you
sample-000279,i want to stay at the oasis the boy answered
sample-000280,and one or two persons were returning
sample-000281,what's in that desk
sample-000282,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
sample-000283,i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
sample-000284,the boy had met the alchemist
sample-000285,so when i look out over your sands i am also looking at her
sample-000286,dusk was falling as the boy arrived with his herd at an abandoned church
sample-000287,everything i do is friendly
sample-000288,because he knew what he would find
sample-000289,in his heart he wanted to remain awake but he also wanted to sleep
sample-000290,the boy didn't say anything
sample-000291,there were just drawings coded instructions and obscure texts
sample-000292,and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
sample-000293,what's your name he asked
sample-000294,that's got nothing to do with it
sample-000295,i heard a faint movement under my feet
sample-000296,the boy swore that every time he heard the alarm he would heed its message
sample-000297,i just don't trust anyone who says they've never had hamburger helper
sample-000298,i have watched the caravan as it crossed the desert he said
sample-000299,we can only perceive a part of the broad light spectrum the sun emits
sample-000300,the dead soldiers were replaced by others and life went on
sample-000301,they blow across the world without a birthplace and with no place to die
sample-000302,finally a young woman approached who was not dressed in black
sample-000303,i don't know you from adam
sample-000304,they were racing down the streets with no regard for anyone
sample-000305,there was very little talking
sample-000306,it was the time of day when all of spain slept during the summer
sample-000307,they erased all evidence of their crimes
sample-000308,theresa couldn't feel any more dumb right now
sample-000309,he's allergic to him
sample-000310,i didn't have time to get some stylish underwear
sample-000311,thirty every thursday sixty at sixty who knows what
sample-000312,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
sample-000313,a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder
sample-000314,sometime during the second year you'll remember about the treasure
sample-000315,i'm not hiding anything the boy answered
sample-000316,you dominated those horsemen with the way you looked at them he said
sample-000317,don't argue with me here
sample-000318,there's a lot more you can do with a tighter integration with the eye tracking api
sample-000319,he knew what i was thinking the boy said to himself
sample-000320,what were you going to write about hillary
sample-000321,he was about the same age and height as the boy
sample-000322,johnathan assessed the situation carefully
sample-000323,that he wanted to travel
sample-000324,sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
sample-000325,he had tried in vain to establish a relationship with an alchemist
sample-000326,he knew nothing about the customs of the strange land he was in
sample-000327,from that day on it was the desert that would be important
sample-000328,it's the oasis said the camel driver
sample-000329,and the girl pointed to the south indicating that it was there the strange man lived
sample-000330,it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
sample-000331,well then why do we need all these books the boy asked
sample-000332,it was a strange furnace fueled by firewood with a transparent flask heating on top
sample-000333,had our instruments permitted it we might have been able to see the trouble way back when
sample-000334,so immerse yourself in it
sample-000335,why did you want to see me the boy asked
sample-000336,be careful with your prognostications said the stranger
sample-000337,his name is welch
sample-000338,they said nothing else
sample-000339,but that was simply because my eye was tired
sample-000340,you don't have to be rich skinny popular or even own a cape to perform a random act of kindness
sample-000341,the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
sample-000342,the man looked at the angel in surprise
sample-000343,but they were not there
sample-000344,then the two went off to have some more tea
sample-000345,that was his work
sample-000346,what your husband was mixed up in
sample-000347,the boy recalled the brilliance he had noticed on the previous day
sample-000350,there is no wine in this country the young man said
sample-000351,the night was warm and i was thirsty
sample-000352,it's the only one they had left
sample-000353,and a labor leader like melville
sample-000354,his way isn't the same as mine nor mine as his
sample-000355,you don't have to be rich skinny popular or even own a cape to perform a random act of kindness
sample-000356,there was no other baggage
sample-000357,but the boy was quiet
sample-000368,they're only made of rock crystal and there are millions of rock crystals in the earth
sample-000369,i want to see the chieftains
sample-000378,then the thing came upon him in a flash
sample-000379,i know that girl
sample-000380,he thought of the woman who had trusted in the desert
sample-000381,but horses tire bit by bit
sample-000382,sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
sample-000383,listen to your heart
sample-000384,to realize one's destiny is a person's only real obligation
sample-000385,hires two personal trainers and make one of them train the other one
sample-000386,the tribal chieftain called for the boy and presented him with fifty pieces of gold
sample-000387,how could he be a fake
sample-000390,all that time the martians must have been getting ready
sample-000391,i feel like a bootlegger
sample-000392,it was dropping off in flakes and raining down on the sand
sample-000393,then get out of here
sample-000394,the accommodation was affordable and cosy
sample-000395,of course the two were unable to do anything
sample-000396,they were both silent for a time observing the plaza and the townspeople
sample-000397,it was however still so hot from its flight through the air
sample-000408,that might be all right
sample-000409,i only interpret dreams
sample-000418,i'm going to them
sample-000419,my wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red green and yellow signal lights
sample-000420,it belongs to me now
sample-000421,has he been here
sample-000422,but instead of being saddened he was happy
sample-000423,you said you wanted fireworks
sample-000424,the boy prodded them one by one with his crook calling each by name
sample-000425,a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder
sample-000426,they set off running wildly into the trees
sample-000427,i wish they were too
sample-000430,they were always just somebody to fill up the bleachers
sample-000431,dont fight fire with fire it would not help
sample-000432,there was a shimmering green light emanating from the statue
sample-000433,the top of the cylinder was rotating on its body
sample-000434,he disappeared into the tent
sample-000435,he just got a new kite for his birthday
sample-000436,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
sample-000437,nobody's trying to steal from you
sample-000440,he had done this for years and knew the schedule of everyone who passed
sample-000441,always heed the omens the old king had said
sample-000442,it commenced to blow harder raising the desert sands
sample-000443,well what good would it be to you if you had t die the alchemist answered
sample-000444,i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
sample-000445,carol saved her brother's life that day
sample-000446,in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
sample-000447,that he had attended a seminary until he was sixteen
sample-000448,i'm going to find that damned alchemist the englishman thought
sample-000449,keep him in here
sample-000450,maybe tomorrow will be better than yesterday
sample-000451,she must have known alex pretty well
sample-000452,the problem is that they don't even realize that they're walking a new road every day
sample-000453,when the simum ceased to blow everyone looked to the place where the boy had been
sample-000454,the forest burned for thirteen days
sample-000455,when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
sample-000456,i have no information about troops or about the movement of the tribes
sample-000457,he washed the detritus from his hair
sample-000458,that's what alchemists do
sample-000459,he dressed in his arabian clothing of white linen bought especially for this day
sample-000460,the restaurant was quite expensive
sample-000461,phone the newspapers
sample-000462,he approached the mass and was surprised at the size and the shape
sample-000463,he arose and taking up his crook began to awaken the sheep that still slept
sample-000464,the shepherd swore that he would
sample-000465,and you've told me nothing along the way said the boy
sample-000466,maktub thought the boy
sample-000467,i didn't frisk him
sample-000468,he dressed in his arabian clothing of white linen bought especially for this day
sample-000469,mostly just the hearts of those who are trying to realize their destinies
sample-000470,you've never been born
sample-000471,hundreds must have seen it and taken it for a falling star
sample-000472,i'm leaving today said the boy
sample-000473,they could barely see the boy
sample-000474,i have to find a man who knows that universal language
sample-000475,and tomorrow his enemy would also be a part of that soul
sample-000476,i noticed that the boy answered
sample-000477,so then try he said to the englishman
sample-000478,i don't believe it
sample-000479,the virus spread faster than wildfire
sample-000480,the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
sample-000481,i understand sheep they're no longer a problem and they can be good friends
sample-000482,the top of the cylinder was rotating on its body
sample-000483,perhaps she met somebody
sample-000484,take your paws off me
sample-000485,apple pie is an iconic dish
sample-000486,am i going to find my treasure he asked
sample-000487,the achieved results are far behind the stateoftheart in image classification
sample-000488,the boy brought his horse closer
sample-000489,coach has heard all about you
sample-000490,the sun was turned into a golden disk
sample-000491,ogilvy watched till one and then gave up
sample-000492,the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
sample-000493,and you ought to read more about the world answered the englishman
sample-000494,if he abandons that pursuit it's because it wasn't truelove
sample-000495,the oasis is neutral ground
sample-000496,what do you say
sample-000497,i had seen all that it would presently bring me
sample-000498,at the first glance it was really not very exciting
sample-000499,sure i know where she lives
sample-000500,he's the man the ads are written for
sample-000501,and above all don't forget to follow your destiny through to its conclusion
sample-000502,her achievements will never be forgotten
sample-000504,we want some action in these pictures
sample-000505,symbols of the little people
sample-000506,this guy stole my watch
sample-000507,it was the most delicious wine he had ever tasted
sample-000508,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
sample-000509,the old man knew how to read and had already read the book
sample-000510,the space was spartan almost bare
sample-000511,do you mind if we go someplace crowded
sample-000512,it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
sample-000513,all they wanted was food and water
sample-000514,it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-000515,he's the only husband i've got
sample-000516,this is for you
sample-000518,he never asked me to sit down in his life
sample-000519,my name's pete davis
sample-000520,pretty nice neck you've got there
sample-000521,an army is coming the boy said
sample-000522,you've never been born
sample-000523,you mean here in the city
sample-000524,remember that wherever your heart is there you will find your treasure
sample-000525,remember that wherever your heart is there you will find your treasure
sample-000526,i have watched the caravan as it crossed the desert he said
sample-000527,the boy approached her to ask about the alchemist
sample-000528,the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
sample-000529,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
sample-000530,as soon as he saw me among the crowd he called to me to come down
sample-000531,he approached the mass and was surprised at the size and the shape
sample-000532,the boy was shocked
sample-000533,the boy felt ill and terribly alone
sample-000534,but that was simply because my eye was tired
sample-000535,will you excuse us a minute
sample-000536,i'm loving it
sample-000537,as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
sample-000538,you can't believe it's not butter
sample-000539,your heart is alive
sample-000540,people from all over the world have passed through this village son said his father
sample-000541,and they had understood each other perfectly well
sample-000542,victoria does things in a much bigger way
sample-000543,i can't find it anywhere
sample-000544,i'd hate to have that many pins stuck in me
sample-000545,but what's all this
sample-000546,they spoke about mercury salt dragons and kings and he didn't understand any of it
sample-000547,they were given to me as a present by a king the boy said
sample-000550,show me where there is life out in the desert
sample-000551,and because the tribes declared war i went to the well seeking the alchemist
sample-000552,where's the old goat
sample-000553,he had seen the shooting star and was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere nearby
sample-000554,doesnt it defeat the purpose of hashing
sample-000555,and that he a boy could perform miracles
sample-000556,it won't hurt you and we can make the city edition
sample-000557,the navy's going to fly father home this afternoon
sample-000568,but i'm going to egypt the boy said
sample-000569,what were you when you came here five years ago
sample-000578,only us explorers can get it
sample-000579,just a memory right now it signified shade water and a refuge from the war
sample-000580,there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
sample-000581,didn't i tell you never to come panhandling around here
sample-000582,this will help you effectively collaborate with developers and coordinate crossteam projects throughout your career
sample-000583,but i didnt think that it contained any living creature
sample-000584,but the crystal merchant had no choice
sample-000585,it is i the boy answered
sample-000586,a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder
sample-000587,just handling them made him feel better
sample-000590,come in again some time
sample-000591,raisins are delicious
sample-000592,he wanted your money he said
sample-000593,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
sample-000594,maybe she didn't even remember him
sample-000595,you mustn't let what she said bother you
sample-000596,so what do you want of me the sun asked
sample-000597,how much money do you get
sample-000608,there's that reprieve if they ever find out
sample-000609,three days from now he would be with the merchant's daughter
sample-000618,one must prepare for it
sample-000619,but it is not a class that was requested by our alumni or prospective students
sample-000620,they were given to me as a present by a king the boy said
sample-000621,it's called the principle of favorability
sample-000622,a man doesn't get in a situation like this every day
sample-000623,can i get a woot woot
sample-000624,i think it's about bird hunting but now i can see how that might be misinterpreted
sample-000625,it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-000626,sunburns can be avoided by applying sunscreen or by staying in the shadows
sample-000627,if you pay attention to the present you can improve upon it
sample-000630,i lost my wallet
sample-000631,all they wanted was food and water
sample-000632,he's nuts about you
sample-000633,and we'll be at larissa's bar up the street
sample-000634,i don't know why these things have to be transmitted by word of mouth he thought
sample-000635,it's the other foreigner the englishman
sample-000636,and a labor leader like melville
sample-000637,they might even have become friends but the englishman closed off the conversation
sample-000640,as soon as he saw me among the crowd he called to me to come down
sample-000641,i can't please everybody
sample-000642,i don't want to change anything because i don't know how to deal with change
sample-000643,if you pay attention to the present you can improve upon it
sample-000644,they went to the kitchen at the back of the monastery
sample-000645,'m all about those invisible cosmic connections that transcend time and distance
sample-000646,if what one finds is made of pure matter it will never spoil
sample-000647,will i learn to do that someday the boy asked
sample-000648,the people will enjoy the tea and want to buy the glasses
sample-000649,hunches his mother used to call them
sample-000650,by the light of their own destruction i saw them staggering and falling and their supporters turning to run
sample-000651,as he did so he talked with the monk about the tribal wars
sample-000652,it had told him to dig where his tears fell
sample-000653,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
sample-000654,mohammed is a wonderful guitar player
sample-000655,i'm trying to explain to my mother how to get pictures off her phone
sample-000656,i'm trying to explain to my mother how to get pictures off her phone
sample-000657,a large piece suddenly came off and fell with a loud and sharp noise
sample-000658,does a man's heart always help him the boy asked the alchemist
sample-000659,love is the falcon's flight over your sands
sample-000660,the top had certainly ceased to rotate
sample-000661,and he knew what was the fair price for every one of his animals
sample-000662,many telescopes were pointed at it
sample-000663,many telescopes were pointed at it
sample-000664,they're calling to us not to give up and to keep on fighting
sample-000665,it was a bundle of money
sample-000666,i just don't trust anyone who says they've never had hamburger helper
sample-000667,ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
sample-000668,he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
sample-000669,i'm going to them
sample-000670,i had the everyone has gary busey's teeth dream again
sample-000671,sunburns can be avoided by applying sunscreen or by staying in the shadows
sample-000672,that's why i'm here
sample-000673,and the last one
sample-000674,a lot of money
sample-000675,absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
sample-000676,sometime during the second year you'll remember about the treasure
sample-000677,i said i wish i'd never been born
sample-000678,they spoke about mercury salt dragons and kings and he didn't understand any of it
sample-000679,i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
sample-000680,are you going to believe every lie he tells you
sample-000681,there was a hole there among the stones
sample-000682,licorice is a black chewy food
sample-000683,i'm not hiding anything the boy answered
sample-000684,the sheep fidgeted nearby uneasy with their new owner and excited by so much change
sample-000685,that day the merchant gave the boy permission to build the display
sample-000686,henderson was taking it in
sample-000687,i myself heard nothing of that
sample-000688,there were mountains in the distance
sample-000689,i didn't come here to have you read my palm he said already regretting having come
sample-000690,i have to admit that my horizon has expanded exponentially
sample-000691,it sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself
sample-000692,those gypsies are really smart he thought
sample-000693,do i look as funny as you do
sample-000694,but i'm liable to get into a jam
sample-000695,all the villagers cheered
sample-000696,they blow across the world without a birthplace and with no place to die
sample-000697,the old man was probably a gypsy too
sample-000698,this morning i found a calculator taped to my wii
sample-000699,you brought a new feeling into my crystal shop
sample-000700,the streamer of gas came out towards us
sample-000701,my mind ran on the possibilities of its content
sample-000702,because he was terrified the boy didn't answer
sample-000703,because the crystal was dirty
sample-000704,they're only made of rock crystal and there are millions of rock crystals in the earth
sample-000705,they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
sample-000706,in some places the ground was covered with the salt of driedup lakes
sample-000707,what good is money to you if you're going to die
sample-000708,the day was dawning and the shepherd urged his sheep in the direction of the sun
sample-000709,sort of a jack london style
sample-000710,that sobered him a little
sample-000711,then the thing came upon him in a flash
sample-000712,he just got a new kite for his birthday
sample-000713,but he granted the travelers three days
sample-000714,well then help me do that the boy said
sample-000715,i am here the boy said
sample-000716,the arrow was pointing to the exit
sample-000717,i'm going to guide you across the desert the alchemist said
sample-000718,do you see this
sample-000719,they were tribesmen dressed in blue with black rings surrounding their turbans
sample-000720,the library is open to everyone
sample-000721,that's comparing apples and oranges
sample-000722,it was a tent like many at the oasis
sample-000723,he decided to concentrate on more practical matters
sample-000724,she wrote the stuff
sample-000725,it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
sample-000726,the hookahs were extinguished and the guards stood at attention
sample-000727,another who was searching the boy's bags found the piece of gold
sample-000728,ogilvy watched till one and then gave up
sample-000729,i never saw amanda act like that before
sample-000730,the alchemist removed the pan from the fire and set it aside to cool
sample-000731,of course you wouldn't know
sample-000732,for every ten dead men among our enemies you will receive a piece of gold
sample-000733,and because the tribes declared war i went to the well seeking the alchemist
sample-000734,because now he knew where his treasure was
sample-000735,do you have any secret hiding place here in the house
sample-000736,you don't have to sign anything
sample-000737,i'm going to need it
sample-000738,i have the money i need to buy my sheep
sample-000739,i bet you forgot the wine
sample-000740,not even the tribal chieftains are able to see him when they want to
sample-000741,but that was simply because my eye was tired
sample-000742,the boy didn't know what to say
sample-000743,as he was leaving he saw in the corner of the room his old shepherd's pouch
sample-000744,is there a mrs joshua
sample-000745,i want you to help me turn myself into the wind the boy answered
sample-000746,you knew the whole story
sample-000747,maybe we'd better ask someone the boy suggested
sample-000750,you dominated those horsemen with the way you looked at them he said
sample-000751,you wanna take this outside
sample-000752,the girl dropped the container and the water spilled
sample-000753,what tricks would i pull
sample-000754,this solution also works well if you want to install a linux distro on windows via virtualization
sample-000755,because for him you are a green field from which he always returns with game
sample-000756,drawing from my own experience as a learner of english and german i value engaging activities that involve everyday conversation
sample-000757,it was only when i got this close to it that the strangeness of it was at all evident to me
sample-000768,the elevators are still running
sample-000769,but use them to buy your flock
sample-000778,air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
sample-000779,the pilots braced themselves for impact
sample-000780,it was a a kind of fascination that paralysed my actions
sample-000781,looking down at the spoon he held the boy saw that the oil was gone
sample-000782,having heard that the boy became even more interested in alchemy
sample-000783,at the first glance it was really not very exciting
sample-000784,and we'll be at larissa's bar up the street
sample-000785,he needed someone to talk to so as to avoid thinking about the possibility of war
sample-000786,it's the oasis said the camel driver
sample-000787,i went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the dark
sample-000790,it's not a lie
sample-000791,it was starlight and i explained the signs of the zodiac to her
sample-000792,had our instruments permitted it we might have been able to see the trouble way back when
sample-000793,strange images passed through my mind
sample-000794,no one paid any attention to the two travelers
sample-000795,he asked it please never to stop speaking to him
sample-000796,well then why do we need all these books the boy asked
sample-000797,just as a rule of thumb
sample-000800,get me walter burns
sample-000801,he was proud of himself
sample-000802,people continued to come and go from the baker's shop
sample-000803,the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
sample-000804,you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
sample-000805,when i'm eating that's all i think about
sample-000806,for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
sample-000807,i wish you'd forget about us
sample-000810,are you crazy the boy asked the alchemist when they had moved on
sample-000811,that's why i keep losing
sample-000812,my allergy has gotten much worse today
sample-000813,i'm talking about the building and loan
sample-000814,been seeing me in your dreams
sample-000815,the stranger withdrew the sword from the boy's forehead and the boy felt immensely relieved
sample-000816,she never grew up
sample-000817,the boy was relieved
sample-000828,most meteorites are more or less rounded
sample-000829,but the alchemist continued to look to the horizon
sample-000838,not to worry said the alchemist
sample-000839,earlier this year we found a really nice place near my office and we moved in together
sample-000840,but that was simply because my eye was tired
sample-000841,the boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid responding to her question
sample-000842,who is your friend the chief asked
sample-000843,two days ago you said that i had never dreamed of travel the merchant answered
sample-000844,'m all about those invisible cosmic connections that transcend time and distance
sample-000845,he paused for a moment to see if the woman knew what the egyptian pyramids were
sample-000846,mecca is a lot farther away than the pyramids
sample-000847,that night he told all of this to the alchemist
sample-000848,the heather was on fire and you could see a thin blue smoke rising up slowly
sample-000849,from there he could see africa in the distance
sample-000850,had our instruments permitted it we might have been able to see the trouble way back when
sample-000851,the alchemist erased the circle in the sand and the snake slithered away among the rocks
sample-000852,i need you to be spontaneous he asked me out to din din
sample-000853,i'm afraid the joke's on us
sample-000854,revenge is not my style but obviously accidents will happen
sample-000855,the boy put the stones in his pouch
sample-000856,the birthday party was a surprise
sample-000857,the wind began to blow again
sample-000858,you can't go any farther one of them said
sample-000859,and what a way to quit
sample-000860,the heather was on fire and you could see a thin blue smoke rising up slowly
sample-000861,i'm the king of salem the old man had said
sample-000862,and stop threatening that boy
sample-000863,then he turned to the boy
sample-000864,for users it is important that they can trust their operating system
sample-000865,well why don't you go to mecca now asked the boy
sample-000866,the monk was irritated
sample-000867,and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
sample-000868,we don't know when the war will end so we can't continue our journey he said
sample-000869,can't you read me
sample-000870,all things are one the boy thought
sample-000871,don't tell me what to do
sample-000872,the problem is that they don't even realize that they're walking a new road every day
sample-000873,that's what i'm going to do
sample-000874,he was older and was carrying a small bucket
sample-000875,will you give me those stamps
sample-000876,i left her hanging around the american express
sample-000877,he had been to the village only once the year before
sample-000878,none of what the old man was saying made much sense to the boy
sample-000879,one day the earth began to tremble and the nile overflowed its banks
sample-000880,whatever the thing observed one could find a connection with his experience of the moment
sample-000881,he had tried in vain to establish a relationship with an alchemist
sample-000882,look at those shoulders
sample-000883,the sun thought for a minute
sample-000884,so he could not be hasty nor impatient
sample-000885,he just got a new kite for his birthday
sample-000886,i will be back soon
sample-000887,we're refugees from the tribal wars and we need money the other figure said
sample-000888,mrs sarah doesn't either
sample-000889,welli don't quite know what to say
sample-000890,he was excited and at the same time uneasy maybe the girl had already forgotten him
sample-000891,i thought you were chasing me
sample-000892,that he wanted to travel
sample-000893,note that it does have builtin support for web browsing although i find it doesn't work very well
sample-000894,the burning fire had been extinguished
sample-000895,there are four different sorts of fuel at this gas station
sample-000896,i gotta figure some way out of this thing
sample-000897,it drew a droplet of blood
sample-000898,this behavior of neural networks is sometimes called dreaming
sample-000899,don't you know there's a war on
sample-000900,then the thing came upon him in a flash
sample-000901,the men fell into an animated discussion
sample-000902,the boy was shaking with fear but the alchemist helped him out of the tent
sample-000903,the crowd swayed a little as i elbowed my way through
sample-000904,all the joy he had seen that morning had suddenly disappeared
sample-000905,i haven't been able to shake him since
sample-000906,i'm afraid i might have soiled the couch a little with my shoes eddie murphy
sample-000907,i went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the dark
sample-000908,the jacket had a purpose and so did the boy
sample-000909,who told you that asked the boy startled
sample-000910,he decided to spend the night there
sample-000911,my father offered her a job
sample-000912,it was papa that sends you flowers every day
sample-000913,another dreamer said the ticket seller to his assistant watching the boy walk away
sample-000914,everyone seemed very excited
sample-000915,i jumped in to save rachel
sample-000916,that's the man who knows all the secrets of the world she said
sample-000917,is the head better
sample-000918,he remembered the sword
sample-000919,that woman is gonna be on that roof
sample-000920,i wished i had a light to smoke by
sample-000921,it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
sample-000922,he recited an our father silently
sample-000923,there were really i think two or three hundred people elbowing one another
sample-000924,and here's a kiss for you
sample-000925,who wrote that speech for you
sample-000926,save that for the tribune
sample-000927,they set off running wildly into the trees
sample-000928,some went away while i was there and other people came
sample-000929,i don't like seals anyhow
sample-000930,they spoke about mercury salt dragons and kings and he didn't understand any of it
sample-000931,and the leader posted armed sentinels at the fringes of the group
sample-000932,there are so many things to learn
sample-000933,yet it was a little too large for assurance
sample-000934,that night there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet
sample-000935,the ship appeared to be constructed with some form of chromium exoskeleton
sample-000936,nobody knows how much ammunition the military has in its checkpoints
sample-000937,it's the philosophy that guarantees everyone's freedom
sample-000938,they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
sample-000939,a line of flame high can be seen in the atmosphere
sample-000948,jennifer's expression changed pull my finger she said
sample-000949,they were both silent for a time observing the plaza and the townspeople
sample-000958,i was scared but wasted no time in going out and crossing the bridge to the sand pits
sample-000959,when he emerged it was with a young arab dressed in white and gold
sample-000960,were they quick or were they enraged
sample-000961,the tribal chieftains will appreciate what you do
sample-000962,at least she knows how to behave at funerals
sample-000963,but there was something there in his heart that wouldn't allow him to do so
sample-000964,the boy saw a man appear behind the counter
sample-000965,but everything that happens twice will surely happen a third time
sample-000966,'and this is what your son said' the angel told the man
sample-000967,but that was simply because my eye was tired
sample-000970,how are you doing today
sample-000971,you should see the other guy specifically how good at fighting he is
sample-000972,if it would save a woman's life
sample-000973,he didn't want any conversation at this point
sample-000974,they were all furious when the escapade failed
sample-000975,it always helps to be learning something new and exciting
sample-000976,where are you bound asked the young arab
sample-000977,at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars
sample-000988,mr bean is the main character of a british comedy
sample-000989,the ideas should be presented in a more concise and direct manner
sample-000998,i need you to be spontaneous he asked me out to din din
sample-000999,how about once more around the park
sample-001000,there was a full moon and the boy told the englishman the story of his life
sample-001001,what would i have to say
sample-001002,the boy thought about the crystal merchant
sample-001003,about eleven i walked back to my home in maybury because nothing seemed to be happening
sample-001004,wasting my time listening to this mad hatter
sample-001005,everything'll be taken care of
sample-001006,you can't trust anybody in this crazy world
sample-001007,am i going to find my treasure he asked
sample-001008,at once he connected the two incidents
sample-001009,i've had this shop for thirty years
sample-001010,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
sample-001011,mister kristen has something to say to us
sample-001012,i've already told you
sample-001013,when i had my sheep i was happy and i made those around me happy
sample-001014,i'll always let you down
sample-001015,at the highest point in tarifa there is an old fort built by the moors
sample-001016,and the odor of the animals became a bit more tolerable
sample-001017,but i sort of like him
sample-001018,it was only when i got this close to it that the strangeness of it was at all evident to me
sample-001019,there is only one way to learn the alchemist answered
sample-001020,i never had any such idea
sample-001021,many of them had been right about what they said while some had been wrong
sample-001022,it was rising slowly and painfully out of the cylinder
sample-001023,why was it that he wanted the boy to serve as his instrument
sample-001024,he remembered something his grandfather had once told him that butterflies were a good omen
sample-001025,everything on earth is being continuously transformed because the earth is alive
sample-001026,sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
sample-001027,sometimes i appear in the form of a solution or a good idea
sample-001028,worked hard just to have food and water like the sheep
sample-001029,as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
sample-001030,i have to separate out the sulfur
sample-001031,she wasn't her type
sample-001032,it was a cobra whose venom could kill a person in minutes
sample-001033,i saw astonishment and horror on the faces of the people around me
sample-001034,we took all the chances
sample-001035,he didn't need to demonstrate his science and art to anyone
sample-001036,all the words you've got
sample-001037,if i could i'd write a huge encyclopedia just about the words luck and coincidence
sample-001038,the genies were the spirits of good and evil
sample-001039,but i'm liable to get into a jam
sample-001048,he was older and was carrying a small bucket
sample-001049,i'll cover the method i use and describe some alternatives
sample-001058,henderson stood up with a spade in his hand
sample-001059,a man down on earth needs our help
sample-001060,the alchemist dismounted slowly and the boy did the same
sample-001061,an huge hole had been made by the impact of the projectile
sample-001062,the lead had dried into the shape of the pan but it was no longer lead
sample-001063,it sure looks good from here
sample-001064,i had to test your courage the stranger said
sample-001065,when the pan had cooled the monk and the boy looked at it dazzled
sample-001066,most of them were staring quietly at the big table
sample-001067,i'm never more aware of a room's acoustics than when i'm trying to enjoy a snack i have no intention of sharing
sample-001070,you are almost at the end of your journey said the alchemist
sample-001071,this samantha tommy movement costs you a fortune
sample-001072,they formed heaps that are visible a mile and a half away
sample-001073,when he was a child that man wanted to travel too
sample-001074,and you've told me nothing along the way said the boy
sample-001075,he took back his books and packed them away again in their bags
sample-001076,but she said nothing
sample-001077,i forgot you were here
sample-001088,starting with his own
sample-001089,as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
sample-001098,that he had attended a seminary until he was sixteen
sample-001099,the woman said she had never heard of such a person and hurried away
sample-001100,i tore him apart
sample-001101,there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
sample-001102,he had helped him out in a dangerous situation
sample-001103,you know what i mean
sample-001104,perhaps she forgot all about it
sample-001105,you have a mania for simplifying everything answered the englishman irritated
sample-001106,august may have ended early
sample-001107,you can't believe it's not butter
sample-001110,this is the press room
sample-001111,that's not true the boy said
sample-001112,the boy and the englishman had bought camels and climbed uncertainly onto their backs
sample-001113,can i get a woot woot
sample-001114,he knew he was stronger than his friend
sample-001115,get me walter burns
sample-001116,looking down at the spoon he held the boy saw that the oil was gone
sample-001117,the englishman said nothing
sample-001128,and they attacked an empty tent
sample-001129,aren't you allowed to kiss back
sample-001138,you must love the desert but never trust it completely
sample-001139,it must have fallen while i was sitting over there
sample-001140,it's a temporary tattoo that looks like a color wheel
sample-001141,edinburgh is a dreamlike place to visit
sample-001142,the baby definitely has the sniffles
sample-001143,look around some time
sample-001144,the following night the boy appeared at the alchemist's tent with a horse
sample-001145,the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
sample-001146,the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
sample-001148,at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars
sample-001149,he had used the two stones only once one morning when he was at a marketplace
sample-001150,but the boy knew that he was referring to fatima
sample-001151,that he had attended a seminary until he was sixteen
sample-001152,and one or two persons were returning
sample-001154,you didn't have to do any cleaning he said
sample-001155,learn to recognize omens and follow them the old king had said
sample-001156,an huge hole had been made by the impact of the projectile
sample-001157,i'll show you what i'm doing
sample-001158,a large piece suddenly came off and fell with a loud and sharp noise
sample-001159,wait for the end of the war
sample-001160,the referee decided on a free kick instead of a penalty kick
sample-001161,the sun was setting when the boy's heart sounded a danger signal
sample-001162,the strange horseman drew an enormous curved sword from a scabbard mounted on his saddle
sample-001163,who asked you to get stuck with any of them
sample-001164,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
sample-001165,that's true the boy thought
sample-001166,all the joy he had seen that morning had suddenly disappeared
sample-001167,what would become of the doctor now that he had saved so many
sample-001168,i have the money i need to buy my sheep
sample-001169,break this crowd up
sample-001170,accidents in nuclear power plants are potentially catastrophic
sample-001171,if he were fed on time he wouldn't cry
sample-001172,at once he connected the two incidents
sample-001173,the tea seemed less bitter
sample-001174,i have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk which was embedded in the ground
sample-001175,he approached the mass and was surprised at the size and the shape
sample-001176,ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
sample-001177,you got plenty of money
sample-001178,ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
sample-001179,the levanter was still getting stronger and he felt its force on his face
sample-001180,full steam ahead said the captain
sample-001181,the boy waited and then interrupted the old man just as he himself had been interrupted
sample-001182,it's called the principle of favorability
sample-001183,the omens had been true after all
sample-001185,suddenly there is so much more time in a day because she no longer has to spend hours commuting
sample-001186,and then he would ask us to go back to our easels and replicate all the techniques in one go
sample-001187,it was his heart that would tell him where his treasure was hidden
sample-001188,then suddenly he noticed it with a start
sample-001189,you've got a nerve accusing people of things
sample-001191,the jacket had a purpose and so did the boy
sample-001192,what'll i tell him
sample-001193,the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
sample-001194,he told fatima that at their next meeting
sample-001195,he didn't need to seek out the old woman for this
sample-001196,we don't know what's in the confounded thing do you
sample-001197,the boy brought his horse closer
sample-001198,i thought you were going to teach me some of the things you know
sample-001199,he took his plate grabbed a knife and fork and scowled at the savagery on television
sample-001200,what are you doing there
sample-001201,if you want something you gotta go get it
sample-001202,the people were also praying to heaven for protection
sample-001203,their software does not listen for virtual keypresses
sample-001204,and then he perceived it very slowly
sample-001205,he came to understand its dodges and tricks and to accept it as it was
sample-001206,it could get a whole lot worse
sample-001207,he has other things to do first
sample-001208,you have a mania for simplifying everything answered the englishman irritated
sample-001209,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
sample-001210,replace the ts in tim tebow's name with any other consonant to get a star wars character
sample-001211,catherine walked alongside the canal
sample-001212,you should see the other guy specifically how good at fighting he is
sample-001213,it was a bundle of money
sample-001214,she wants to send you on a lecture tour
sample-001215,i have no information about troops or about the movement of the tribes
sample-001216,i think it's plenty terrific
sample-001217,some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound
sample-001218,i'll take mine now
sample-001219,i thought sure you'd remember me
sample-001220,i've crossed these sands many times said one of the camel drivers one night
sample-001221,can you imagine that
sample-001222,can you remember anything at all
sample-001223,yes that's what love is
sample-001224,most meteorites are more or less rounded
sample-001225,and you can meet us at the station
sample-001226,why did you want to see me the boy asked
sample-001227,because you'll know its dreams and wishes and will know how to deal with them
sample-001228,he remembered what the old man had said about offering something you didn't even have yet
sample-001229,the sticker was peeling from the item
sample-001230,i didn't come here to have you read my palm he said already regretting having come
sample-001231,they set off running wildly into the trees
sample-001232,it spread through the planet's atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features
sample-001233,so he asked if the old man's blessing was still with him
sample-001234,i'm doing much better and soon you'll be able to return to your sheep
sample-001235,all beverages in this shop are free of alcohol
sample-001236,there's nothing more we can do tonight
sample-001237,not with my money
sample-001238,the alchemist rode in front with the falcon on his shoulder
sample-001239,it was starlight and i explained the signs of the zodiac to her
sample-001248,the boy didn't know what to say
sample-001249,i was just asking
sample-001258,air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
sample-001259,i shall make us some ice cubes
sample-001260,from where i am the sun said i can see the soul of the world
sample-001261,no offense but your agility leaves a lot to be desired
sample-001262,you can't go any farther one of them said
sample-001263,and one can always come back
sample-001264,the hookahs were extinguished and the guards stood at attention
sample-001265,i won't shut up
sample-001266,i need ten dollars
sample-001267,the three fell silent
sample-001270,i'm going to become bitter and distrustful of people because one person betrayed me
sample-001271,you can't go in there until you put this on
sample-001272,a hundred nuns stampeded the vatican
sample-001273,now go eat your dinner
sample-001274,at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
sample-001275,the owner of the bar came over and looked as well
sample-001276,in one he had read that many years ago a famous arabian alchemist had visited europe
sample-001277,i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
sample-001288,you will be jane doe
sample-001289,suddenly he disappeared and i could hear a faint shriek behind the walls
sample-001298,lots of shepherds passed through selling their wool
sample-001299,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
sample-001300,i can't think of any reason why she was killed
sample-001301,then you'll die in the midst of trying to realize your destiny
sample-001302,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
sample-001303,and in that mood he was grateful to be in love
sample-001304,i hate sneakers but i am liking these shoes
sample-001305,i'm an adventurer looking for treasure he said to himself
sample-001306,the boy knew the desert sensed his fear
sample-001307,and there were dunes rocks and plants that insisted on living where survival seemed impossible
sample-001310,but it just so happens i've got a picture of her
sample-001311,and your camels will bring you wealth and power
sample-001312,the boy smiled and continued digging
sample-001313,then came the night of the first falling star
sample-001314,it spread through the planet's atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features
sample-001315,and for wise men gold is the metal that evolved the furthest
sample-001316,the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
sample-001317,the woman was silent for some time
sample-001328,never heard of such a thing
sample-001329,you'll watch them as they grow demonstrating how the world is always changing
sample-001338,they're not worth much the englishman answered
sample-001339,they're not for sale he said
sample-001340,as he did so he talked with the monk about the tribal wars
sample-001341,the level ground was blackened as far as one could see and it was still giving off smoke
sample-001342,firewalls can be used to protect a network against intruders
sample-001343,what's that got to do with it
sample-001344,the visual acuity is astonishing
sample-001345,my chinchilla eats bread
sample-001346,could i please see you a minute
sample-001347,but he kept quiet because he had heard what the alchemist said to the monk
sample-001348,the two men hurried back and found the cylinder still lying in the same position
sample-001349,but this'll teach them a lesson
sample-001350,on the following day the first clear sign of danger appeared
sample-001351,i need four hundred and fifty dollars in counterfeit money
sample-001352,the strange horseman drew an enormous curved sword from a scabbard mounted on his saddle
sample-001353,he tried again to concentrate on the pink shades of the desert and its stones
sample-001354,that's why i'm here
sample-001355,it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-001356,you mean you and me
sample-001357,the alchemist erased the circle in the sand and the snake slithered away among the rocks
sample-001358,the two men hurried back and found the cylinder still lying in the same position
sample-001359,well then help me do that the boy said
sample-001360,i've got to go to him
sample-001361,whatever the thing observed one could find a connection with his experience of the moment
sample-001362,i thought about whether we should find coins and models in it and so on
sample-001363,you'd better take it easy
sample-001364,he found the toilet occupied
sample-001365,you were going to go out and conquer the world
sample-001366,the city sealer's office
sample-001367,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
sample-001368,wait for the end of the war
sample-001369,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
sample-001370,as the englishman left fatima arrived and filled her vessel with water
sample-001371,henderson stood up with a spade in his hand
sample-001372,i don't know about war
sample-001373,among these people were a couple of cyclists a gardener i employed sometimes and a girl carrying a baby
sample-001374,nothing's going to happen
sample-001375,that's the philosopher's stone and the elixir of life
sample-001376,the genies were the spirits of good and evil
sample-001377,dense clouds of smoke or dust can be seen through a powerful telescope
sample-001378,several figures approached him
sample-001379,in his heart he wanted to remain awake but he also wanted to sleep
sample-001380,i shouldn't have done that
sample-001381,people say strange things the boy thought
sample-001382,this morning i found a calculator taped to my wii
sample-001383,at the first glance it was really not very exciting
sample-001384,the merchant turned to a customer who wanted three crystal glasses
sample-001385,gimme the receiving room
sample-001386,what am i going to say to elvis
sample-001387,who's down there with you
sample-001388,what do you mean it's okay
sample-001389,the wireless joypad was experiencing connection issues
sample-001390,the guy thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to stop him
sample-001391,with the wars between the tribes it's impossible to cross the desert
sample-001392,mrs jason is on the phone
sample-001393,the guy thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to stop him
sample-001394,let me talk to him
sample-001395,for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
sample-001396,the next day he gave his son a pouch that held three ancient spanish gold coins
sample-001397,there is only one way to learn the alchemist answered
sample-001398,and one or two persons were returning
sample-001399,but everyone and his aunt lilian's been through that bag
sample-001400,your son went to serve at a distant place and became a centurion
sample-001401,the streamer of gas came out towards us
sample-001402,everybody knows you're a sweetheart
sample-001403,how would the method behave with kernels of different size
sample-001404,what boat you sailing on
sample-001405,mrs sarah doesn't either
sample-001406,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
sample-001407,they were all furious when the escapade failed
sample-001408,it was linda keller
sample-001409,who's that with the hat
sample-001410,maybe tomorrow will be better than yesterday
sample-001411,you must love the desert but never trust it completely
sample-001412,the alchemist dismounted and told the escorts they could return to the camp
sample-001413,he fell asleep and when he awoke the sun was already high
sample-001414,hires two personal trainers and make one of them train the other one
sample-001415,the woman sat down and told him to be seated as well
sample-001416,it must have fallen while i was sitting over there
sample-001417,let me tell you what will happen
sample-001418,the boy saw a man appear behind the counter
sample-001419,what are they doing the old man asked pointing at the people in the plaza
sample-001420,he wrapped the twigs in a piece of cloth and put them back in his bag
sample-001421,if we serve tea in crystal the shop is going to expand
sample-001422,i'll give you three minutes to tell me where she is
sample-001423,the plumber tightened the leaking valve
sample-001424,don't they believe in angels
sample-001425,when the judge spoke the death sentence the defendant showed no emotion
sample-001426,it is i the boy answered
sample-001427,i shall make us some ice cubes
sample-001428,so it's better to listen to what it has to say
sample-001429,so his heart was quiet for an entire afternoon
sample-001430,nobody's trying to steal from you
sample-001431,and it knew nothing about love
sample-001432,she was throwing snowballs at the sky
sample-001433,now who'da done a mean thing like that
sample-001434,the pixel probabilities are conditioned on the model state
sample-001435,the boy knew and was now working toward it
sample-001436,at once he connected the two incidents
sample-001437,you can't say that about my father
sample-001438,it's got to be somewhere
sample-001439,he just got a new kite for his birthday
sample-001448,i'm surprised the boy said
sample-001449,there were really i think two or three hundred people elbowing one another
sample-001458,or a man into the wind
sample-001459,i don't know why
sample-001460,i don't know why
sample-001461,this is a resourceintensive process that requires expensive closedsource speech data to get a good model
sample-001462,most meteorites are more or less rounded
sample-001463,she supports a mother and two kids
sample-001464,our deadline is coming up rapidly and we will need help
sample-001465,we've passed her up right along
sample-001466,i'm afraid that if my dream is realized i'll have no reason to go on living
sample-001467,i like the way she talks
sample-001470,now i will drift gently off to dreamland
sample-001471,having heard that the boy became even more interested in alchemy
sample-001472,our religion dictates our actions
sample-001473,the problem is that they don't even realize that they're walking a new road every day
sample-001474,he seemed unfriendly and had looked irritated when the boy had entered
sample-001475,i think it's marvelous
sample-001476,but there was something there in his heart that wouldn't allow him to do so
sample-001477,my tax dollars pay for those public school proms
sample-001488,he understands the forces of nature
sample-001489,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
sample-001498,i'll talk to you tonight
sample-001499,the vision vanished immediately but it had shaken him
sample-001500,i don't blame him
sample-001501,this is a trick to get your sympathy
sample-001502,the old man said nothing
sample-001503,the boy thought it a strange question
sample-001504,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
sample-001505,aldo and his grandma quickly discovered a new passion for coding
sample-001506,and i'm certain you'll find it the alchemist said
sample-001507,can't you just observe men and omens in order to understand the language the boy asked
sample-001510,you been in a fight
sample-001511,they made the boy continue digging but he found nothing
sample-001512,he was just and good
sample-001513,he became friendly with the camel driver who traveled alongside him
sample-001514,isn't it a little crowded
sample-001515,somehow the purple colour faded to gray
sample-001516,you'll live and you'll learn that a man shouldn't be so stupid
sample-001517,i've been to your house a hundred times
sample-001528,before the boy could reply a butterfly appeared and fluttered between him and the old man
sample-001529,i guess i used all the shells
sample-001538,she will go down in history as the greatest brain surgeon in the world
sample-001539,that's a lot of gold
sample-001540,that day he didn't make a cast
sample-001541,she looks as though she's going to come to
sample-001542,he needed someone to talk to so as to avoid thinking about the possibility of war
sample-001543,there's been too much talk going on in this world
sample-001544,the coffee had a very strong taste
sample-001545,you've put one administration out and another in
sample-001546,some of the grey ash was falling off the circular edge
sample-001547,you told me that
sample-001548,the execution was cancelled
sample-001549,the miner had abandoned everything to go mining for emeralds
sample-001550,how strange africa is thought the boy
sample-001551,but the marketplace was empty and he was far from home so he wept
sample-001552,that's exactly what i thought
sample-001553,but nowhere could he find his new companion
sample-001554,so it's better to listen to what it has to say
sample-001555,the population was increasing exponentially
sample-001556,she's going to lose her mind when she finds out
sample-001557,will i learn to do that someday the boy asked
sample-001558,so what should i do now the boy asked
sample-001559,i don't much like change he said
sample-001560,edinburgh is a dreamlike place to visit
sample-001561,love required them to stay with the people they loved
sample-001562,it's not my house
sample-001563,the stranger was speaking of things that very few people knew about
sample-001564,some storms are worth the wreckage
sample-001565,strange images passed through my mind
sample-001566,so he began to wander through the city and found himself at the gates
sample-001567,no one seemed to have thought about it that night
sample-001568,almost everyone here speaks spanish
sample-001569,then suppose you give me the money
sample-001570,it was dropping off in flakes and raining down on the sand
sample-001571,excuse me nudism is not allowed at this part of the beach
sample-001572,it didn't even occur to the boy to flee
sample-001573,someplace you could have put it
sample-001574,revenge is not my style but obviously accidents will happen
sample-001575,i haven't heard the baby complain yet
sample-001576,scattered groups of people were hurrying from the direction of woking
sample-001577,did you say a king he asked
sample-001578,katie screamed that they were going to lose
sample-001579,i don't think i know that one
sample-001580,you'd better get dressed
sample-001581,i'm going out and find them
sample-001582,i myself heard nothing of that
sample-001583,they wanted to save the oasis
sample-001584,of course the two were unable to do anything
sample-001585,let's go and have some lunch said the crystal merchant
sample-001586,mr lee can't be bothered now
sample-001587,sirens blared as they raced into the heart of the crowded metropolis
sample-001588,what did you stop it for
sample-001589,the omens will begin insistently to speak of it and you'll try to ignore them
sample-001590,i'm just too miserable
sample-001591,an alchemist said the alchemist
sample-001592,well then we've got a problem
sample-001593,and i'd better read your books said the boy
sample-001594,that's not carson sphinx
sample-001595,the immense collection of people and animals began to travel faster
sample-001596,it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
sample-001597,air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
sample-001598,what did you say
sample-001599,an old man with a breastplate of gold wouldn't have lied just to acquire six sheep
sample-001600,that's true the boy thought
sample-001601,she didn't have one
sample-001602,the man wept with happiness
sample-001603,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
sample-001604,drink and enjoy yourself said the alchemist noticing that the boy was feeling happier
sample-001605,the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
sample-001606,what's your name he asked
sample-001607,the englishman said nothing
sample-001608,suppose there was a shane york and he walked into this office
sample-001610,get your guns out
sample-001611,listen to that mob
sample-001612,what was all that
sample-001613,dense clouds of smoke or dust can be seen through a powerful telescope
sample-001614,an huge hole had been made by the impact of the projectile
sample-001615,the reader does not need to know how it is actually computed
sample-001616,now i too will be one of the women who wait
sample-001617,the boy didn't want to talk about the pyramids
sample-001618,and the murmur lasted longer than a simple vow would have
sample-001619,what do i do in salem the old man laughed
sample-001620,the pixel probabilities are conditioned on the model state
sample-001622,it was the first time either had touched the other
sample-001623,i thought i'd give the kids a treat
sample-001624,how strange africa is thought the boy
sample-001625,he felt weighted down by the centuries of time since the pyramids had been built
sample-001626,the treasure is at the pyramids that you already knew
sample-001627,he saw the boy appear from the other side of the dunes
sample-001628,if you pay attention to the present you can improve upon it
sample-001629,he had always believed that the sheep were able to understand what he said
sample-001630,after two hours he returned to the room where the wise man was
sample-001631,replace the ts in tim tebow's name with any other consonant to get a star wars character
sample-001632,he had never imagined that questions about life would be of such importance to a shepherd
sample-001633,when he's an old man he's going to spend a month in africa
sample-001634,the arabs laughed at him and the alchemist laughed along
sample-001636,you're the one who may die the alchemist said
sample-001637,and maybe it wasn't that they were teaching me but that i was learning from them
sample-001638,because the crystal was dirty
sample-001639,what kind of blow should one deliver next in order to remain alive
sample-001648,one night the father had a dream
sample-001649,if good things are coming they will be a pleasant surprise said the seer
sample-001658,but they were not there
sample-001659,there was surely a baker in her town
sample-001660,what do you want done with them tomorrow morning
sample-001661,the boy awoke before dawn
sample-001662,suddenly a huge quantity of green smoke came out of the pit in three puffs and went straight into the still air
sample-001663,he's hardly my mr doyle
sample-001664,look at the bottle you took the powder from
sample-001665,in a way so am i he said
sample-001666,they're starting to throw things
sample-001667,the top of the cylinder was rotating on its body
sample-001670,be less complicated without a family
sample-001671,most meteorites are more or less rounded
sample-001672,when she called her friend for help with her computer she repeatedly emphasized that she hadn't done anything
sample-001673,he was selling better than ever
sample-001674,i want those stamps
sample-001675,the boy smiled to himself
sample-001676,the world speaks many languages the boy thought
sample-001677,only when he himself reveals it
sample-001688,it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
sample-001689,all things are one the old man had said
sample-001698,he ran his fingers slowly over the stones sensing their temperature and feeling their surfaces
sample-001699,a frightening concept occured to jennifer
sample-001700,we're a different world
sample-001701,i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit
sample-001702,the girl dropped the container and the water spilled
sample-001703,give it to me
sample-001704,you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
sample-001705,amy's a genius at research
sample-001706,every day was there to be lived or to mark one's departure from this world
sample-001707,his hands began to tremble and the woman sensed it
sample-001710,but the boy couldn't even speak
sample-001711,for a site titled handsfree coding i haven't written much about how to actually write the code
sample-001712,there was very little talking
sample-001713,all that time the martians must have been getting ready
sample-001714,i don't care what you charge them with
sample-001715,it all happened rather suddenly
sample-001716,everything in the universe evolved he said
sample-001717,and i'm certain you'll find it the alchemist said
sample-001728,he drew on the back of his jacket with a blue fountain pen
sample-001729,they rented a boat and went down the river
sample-001738,because i've always heard about them the boy answered saying nothing about his dream
sample-001739,the cushion was soft and inviting
sample-001740,he didn't want to cry with the other people there
sample-001741,toward the end of the afternoon they came upon a coptic monastery
sample-001742,what could i do
sample-001743,what is an alchemist he asked finally
sample-001744,i'm gonna get my arm fixed out of this
sample-001745,'m all about those invisible cosmic connections that transcend time and distance
sample-001746,it was the levanter the wind that came from africa
sample-001747,the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
sample-001748,and he gave you that five dollar raise
sample-001749,it was better than the scent of the hookahs
sample-001750,i didn't come here to have you read my palm he said already regretting having come
sample-001751,a long note was sounded on a bugle and everyone mounted up
sample-001752,scattered groups of people were hurrying from the direction of woking
sample-001753,the camel driver was not a fighter and he had consulted with seers
sample-001754,i've always looked on bessie as my own sister
sample-001755,it's like the flight of those two hawks it can't be understood by reason alone
sample-001756,just things like that
sample-001757,the wind has many names
sample-001758,yes or even search for treasure
sample-001759,i thought about whether we should find coins and models in it and so on
sample-001760,the owner of the bar came over and looked as well
sample-001761,there was no respite to be had
sample-001762,i shall make us some ice cubes
sample-001763,in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
sample-001764,now what's the story
sample-001765,three to two in our favor
sample-001766,there was no excuse for goodman to fly off the handle
sample-001767,this is a very interesting situation
sample-001768,because you are trying to realize your destiny
sample-001769,so we their hearts speak more and more softly
sample-001770,you were seen at the enemy camp three days ago
sample-001771,to save fuel the ariane rocket has been launched not far from the equator
sample-001772,let's get out of here said the new arrival
sample-001773,he knew nothing about the customs of the strange land he was in
sample-001774,the treasure is at the pyramids that you already knew
sample-001775,and so despite the fact that he was a roman centurion he converted to their faith
sample-001776,some went away while i was there and other people came
sample-001777,advancing slowly they searched among the stones
sample-001778,everybody knows you're a sweetheart
sample-001779,and about you too
sample-001780,the boy looked out at the horizon
sample-001781,let me comb your hair
sample-001782,they are so used to me that they know my schedule he muttered
sample-001783,henderson stood up with a spade in his hand
sample-001784,and she already has her treasure it's you
sample-001785,just as your grandfather taught you
sample-001786,the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
sample-001787,what time is it
sample-001788,there was a full moon and the boy told the englishman the story of his life
sample-001789,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
sample-001790,the boy had never even noticed that there was a hole in his pouch
sample-001791,the war continued and at times the wind carried the sweet sickly smell of blood
sample-001792,at once he connected the two incidents
sample-001793,but men began to reject simple things and to write tracts interpretations and philosophical studies
sample-001794,in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
sample-001795,it seemed such a little thing so bright and small and still
sample-001796,but can we trust him
sample-001797,he had used the two stones only once one morning when he was at a marketplace
sample-001798,you must always know what it is that you want the old king had said
sample-001799,some of our biggest clients are affected
sample-001800,as he sat there thinking he sensed movement above him
sample-001801,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
sample-001802,he told fatima that at their next meeting
sample-001803,it's gonna put our city on the map
sample-001804,henderson stood up with a spade in his hand
sample-001805,the londoners regretted visiting this awful place
sample-001807,arabs often appeared in the city shopping and chanting their strange prayers several times a day
sample-001808,i'm going to hate those who have found their treasure because i never found mine
sample-001809,she ought to be here any minute
sample-001810,turkey for thanksgiving
sample-001811,many telescopes were pointed at it
sample-001813,i've had this shop for thirty years
sample-001814,will you excuse us a minute
sample-001815,and one or two persons were returning
sample-001816,i'm sure i don't know what you're talking about
sample-001817,that florescent pink colour is hurting my eyes
sample-001818,the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
sample-001819,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
sample-001820,and he hadn't perceived them because he had become accustomed to them
sample-001821,i don't know how to explain it
sample-001822,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
sample-001823,i have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk which was embedded in the ground
sample-001824,but you are in the desert
sample-001825,my seven year resume gap is marked not drugs
sample-001826,the tractor was bearing down hard
sample-001827,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
sample-001828,the nearby city of ceuta had grown faster than tangier and business had fallen off
sample-001829,it was difficult not to think about what he had left behind
sample-001830,but the king of salem hoped desperately that the boy would be successful
sample-001831,and he knew that egypt was in africa
sample-001832,all this happened between sunrise and sunset the boy thought
sample-001833,well he thought about that the old man said
sample-001834,don't you remember the home i promised you
sample-001835,the plastic barrier shattered
sample-001836,the monk was irritated
sample-001837,but now the sounds inside had stopped
sample-001838,and then he would ask us to go back to our easels and replicate all the techniques in one go
sample-001839,a large piece suddenly came off and fell with a loud and sharp noise
sample-001840,you're just the one i wanted to see
sample-001841,i'm getting married tomorrow
sample-001842,the horizon was tinged with red and suddenly the sun appeared
sample-001843,the boy had never even noticed that there was a hole in his pouch
sample-001844,air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
sample-001845,but everything that happens twice will surely happen a third time
sample-001846,he sat looking at the sky for a long time
sample-001847,because i've always heard about them the boy answered saying nothing about his dream
sample-001850,there was a hole there among the stones
sample-001851,the last time she came in here
sample-001852,but there's a tribal war the boy reiterated
sample-001853,now im scared of what is inside of pies
sample-001854,people say strange things the boy thought
sample-001855,in a way so am i he said
sample-001856,he thought of the merchant's daughter and was sure that she had probably married
sample-001857,but a lovely chap
sample-001868,'and this is what your son said' the angel told the man
sample-001869,no one can be from many places the boy said
sample-001878,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
sample-001879,maybe tomorrow will be better than yesterday
sample-001880,he lives at the alfayoum oasis his friend had said
sample-001881,he told fatima that at their next meeting
sample-001882,but they were not there
sample-001883,what are you doing tonight
sample-001884,he knew all the fields and pastures of andalusia
sample-001885,she loves to read but is unsure how reading is helping her become more creative
sample-001886,i noticed that the boy answered
sample-001887,this man looked exactly the same except that now the roles were reversed
sample-001890,alchemy is a serious discipline
sample-001891,what had been next to him five minutes ago was now at the other side
sample-001892,your government is counting on you
sample-001893,and she already has her treasure it's you
sample-001894,remember the night we broke the windows in this old house
sample-001895,the reprieve for george
sample-001896,you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
sample-001897,don't say that again
sample-001908,the next day the boy returned to the well hoping to see the girl
sample-001909,at the highest point in tarifa there is an old fort built by the moors
sample-001918,i've been trying to get her to come to
sample-001919,and he told what he had seen
sample-001920,hundreds must have seen it and taken it for a falling star
sample-001921,i have been waiting for her to respond for two days now so i just went ahead and did it for her
sample-001922,there was a hole there among the stones
sample-001923,my mind ran on the possibilities of its content
sample-001924,the company's stock value increased dramatically after they found a new medicine
sample-001925,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
sample-001926,enough said the boy
sample-001927,i just don't trust anyone who says they've never had hamburger helper
sample-001930,the invaders carried the name everywhere the beautiful girl spoke of the invaders with pride
sample-001931,the thought was so dreadful to him that he forgot about the heat and went forward
sample-001932,the top had certainly ceased to rotate
sample-001933,did she ever marry the girl
sample-001934,the thought was so dreadful to him that he forgot about the heat and went forward
sample-001935,and he wasn't faring much better
sample-001936,i've got to go to him
sample-001937,because we're the people and we're tough
sample-001940,will you come here
sample-001941,the old man knew how to read and had already read the book
sample-001942,i'm looking for a treasure said the boy and he immediately regretted having said it
sample-001943,they'll never close us up today
sample-001944,he must know how to deal with the snakes of the desert
sample-001945,you certainly delivered the goods
sample-001946,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
sample-001947,i wished i had a light to smoke by
sample-001948,all i say is spit them out
sample-001949,what's the fifth obligation the boy asked
sample-001950,when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
sample-001951,the crowd swayed a little as i elbowed my way through
sample-001952,a boy came running towards me
sample-001953,the usb device didn't function correctly
sample-001954,we're a different world
sample-001955,you must love the desert but never trust it completely
sample-001956,he was immensely excited at the news
sample-001957,he must be disguised to avoid encounters with thieves
sample-001958,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
sample-001959,why does melissandre look like she wants to consume jon snow on the ride up the wall
sample-001960,why do they make things so complicated he asked the englishman one night
sample-001961,he didn't want his hand to begin trembling showing the old woman that he was fearful
sample-001962,the sun was turned into a golden disk
sample-001963,with this kind of organization i find it's much easier to prioritize within a category
sample-001964,that first day everyone slept from exhaustion including the englishman
sample-001965,we lit the lantern and walked over to his house
sample-001966,i'm never more aware of a room's acoustics than when i'm trying to enjoy a snack i have no intention of sharing
sample-001967,don't you push me around like that
sample-001968,the homeless seem to like soup
sample-001969,i am following my destiny
sample-001970,i was scared but wasted no time in going out and crossing the bridge to the sand pits
sample-001971,all that time the martians must have been getting ready
sample-001972,his name is welch
sample-001973,just a memory right now it signified shade water and a refuge from the war
sample-001974,i'd like you to take me there if you can
sample-001975,about eleven i walked back to my home in maybury because nothing seemed to be happening
sample-001976,and the nightgown had changed into a beautiful wedding gown
sample-001977,nobody wanted to discuss how we all ended up trapped in a giant lunchbox
sample-001978,this is the first phase of the job he said
sample-001979,you just pat him
sample-001980,that was until the site was blocked
sample-001981,turning the air conditioning on leads to an increased fuel consumption
sample-001982,we'll have something to drink and eat these hawks
sample-001983,are you crazy the boy asked the alchemist when they had moved on
sample-001984,why a revolver he asked
sample-001985,will you help me
sample-001986,this time we're going to get it right
sample-001987,that guy over there likes to drink a lot talk a lot but do nothing
sample-001988,he asked for him
sample-001989,i had the everyone has gary busey's teeth dream again
sample-001990,the wind began to blow again
sample-001991,it's not a battle of good against evil
sample-001992,they shouted consolation and promises and went off back to the town again to get help
sample-001993,excuse you for what
sample-001994,a poor little fellow that never meant nobody no harm
sample-001995,will you try to get some sleep
sample-001996,you may not have a great deal of time
sample-001997,he approached the mass and was surprised at the size and the shape
sample-001998,i ain't gonna squeal
sample-001999,and that's where the power of love comes in
sample-002008,from here on you will be alone the alchemist said
sample-002009,that makes sense the alchemist answered
sample-002018,and you've told me nothing along the way said the boy
sample-002019,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
sample-002020,he felt uneasy at the man's presence
sample-002021,the boy's heart began to speak of fear
sample-002022,now that's too much
sample-002023,they set off running wildly into the trees
sample-002024,the problem is that they don't even realize that they're walking a new road every day
sample-002025,it's almost as if he had been here and left his mark he thought
sample-002026,another trick the boy thought
sample-002027,carol hid inside the shipping container
sample-002030,at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
sample-002031,air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
sample-002032,when he reached the top of the dune his heart leapt
sample-002033,who do you think
sample-002034,everything i say is right
sample-002035,that's why i'm quitting
sample-002036,the boy was shocked
sample-002037,what's the world's greatest lie the boy asked completely surprised
sample-002040,you'll use your knowledge for the welfare of the oasis and its inhabitants
sample-002041,they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
sample-002042,i locked eyes with a fish in the tank
sample-002043,these scissors can cut metal
sample-002044,he walked slowly through the market
sample-002045,some place to live
sample-002046,pencils down time is over
sample-002047,tell nathan to get on the extension
sample-002048,maybe this is an omen said the englishman half aloud
sample-002049,and at that i told him and he took my place
sample-002050,didn't you hear him
sample-002051,even then he hardly understood what this meant
sample-002052,the newspaper articles had prepared everyone for the reception of the idea
sample-002053,there's just so much a body can do
sample-002054,that doesn't happen to just anyone
sample-002055,and if you improve on the present what comes later will also be better
sample-002056,glaciers are melting because of global warming
sample-002057,the sun was setting when the boy's heart sounded a danger signal
sample-002058,i just don't trust anyone who says they've never had hamburger helper
sample-002059,reindeer and antelopes are missing in your taxonomy of animals
sample-002060,and she already has her treasure it's you
sample-002061,the hunter was alerted by the sound of rustling vegetation behind her
sample-002062,go and speak to the tribal chieftains said the camel driver
sample-002063,you must not let up even after having come so far he continued
sample-002064,without such love one's dreams would have no meaning
sample-002065,it was a pleasant change from talking to his sheep
sample-002066,don't you think i know where i live
sample-002067,as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
sample-002068,you've got the brain of a pancake
sample-002069,i'm beginning to think women make the best spies
sample-002070,he arose and taking up his crook began to awaken the sheep that still slept
sample-002071,an army is coming the boy said
sample-002072,there was a small building there with a window at which people bought tickets to africa
sample-002073,foxes are really intelligent creatures
sample-002074,look at those shoulders
sample-002075,he just got a new kite for his birthday
sample-002076,what are you talking about
sample-002077,it's going to take a while the boy said
sample-002078,he knelt down to find urim and thummim and put them back in the pouch
sample-002079,with every day that passed the boy's heart became more and more silent
sample-002080,and don't bump into anything
sample-002081,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
sample-002082,was it my fault
sample-002083,well then stand up
sample-002084,the gods should not have desires because they don't have destinies
sample-002085,it's true that everything has its destiny but one day that destiny will be realized
sample-002086,the end of the cylinder was still as ogilvy and henderson had left it
sample-002087,there was surely a baker in her town
sample-002088,if i could i'd write a huge encyclopedia just about the words luck and coincidence
sample-002089,love required them to stay with the people they loved
sample-002090,some went away while i was there and other people came
sample-002091,the priest collapsed backwards
sample-002092,of course the two were unable to do anything
sample-002093,queuing is something the british excel at
sample-002094,i'll see you after
sample-002095,my tax dollars pay for those public school proms
sample-002096,there's life here the boy said to the alchemist
sample-002097,they become the soul o f the world
sample-002098,now his intuition was that he had been right in coming
sample-002099,they never have to make any decisions he thought
sample-002100,it was faintly marked with transverse stripes and slightly flattened from the perfect round
sample-002101,any statement on the red uprising tomorrow
sample-002102,it spread through the planet's atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features
sample-002103,they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
sample-002104,i would appreciate if you could create a concise table
sample-002105,were you paid for it or weren't you
sample-002106,they're not for sale he said
sample-002107,that's a good luck omen the englishman said after the fat arab had gone out
sample-002108,the stranger seemed satisfied with the answer
sample-002109,ten years at the university and here i am in a corral
sample-002110,absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
sample-002111,everything in life is an omen said the englishman now closing the journal he was reading
sample-002112,until one of them dies i couldn't possibly meet anyone else
sample-002113,they must be used to their new shepherd and have probably already forgotten me
sample-002114,this was my destiny not yours the alchemist answered
sample-002115,'everyone loved them and enjoyed them
sample-002116,he had assumed he would soon return to his sheep
sample-002117,ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
sample-002118,imagine if everyone went around transforming lead into gold
sample-002119,but he still couldn't flee
sample-002120,dusk was falling as the boy arrived with his herd at an abandoned church
sample-002121,there's that reprieve if they ever find out
sample-002122,he knew how to shear them and how to slaughter them
sample-002123,the same hand that had brandished the sword now held a whip
sample-002124,dense clouds of smoke or dust can be seen through a powerful telescope
sample-002125,you're a man disgusted with all of civilization
sample-002126,i was torn between fear and curiosity
sample-002127,the next day the boy met the old man at noon
sample-002128,and in that way the months passed
sample-002129,i need it to get to the pyramids he said
sample-002130,the boy was trying to understand the truth of what the old man had said
sample-002131,it was starlight and i explained the signs of the zodiac to her
sample-002132,the englishman was disappointed
sample-002133,the two walked out among the palms
sample-002134,he was immensely excited at the news
sample-002135,that's why i'm here
sample-002136,the secretary tugged at a loose fibre
sample-002137,he was alarmed by what had happened
sample-002138,he couldn't have been wrong
sample-002139,everybody quiet and ready for an emergency
sample-002140,one must prepare for it
sample-002141,and he asked the boy if he too were in search of the alchemist
sample-002142,the two men hurried back and found the cylinder still lying in the same position
sample-002143,ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
sample-002144,there were raised voicesand some sort of struggle appeared to be going on 
sample-002145,it took her a while to get used to it
sample-002146,judge tully is in
sample-002147,you don't have to be rich skinny popular or even own a cape to perform a random act of kindness
sample-002150,and the murmur lasted longer than a simple vow would have
sample-002151,it's the other foreigner the englishman
sample-002152,i was just asking
sample-002153,melchizedek watched a small ship that was plowing its way out of the port
sample-002154,but bakers are more important people than shepherds
sample-002155,you just pat him
sample-002156,i dreamt i was your father
sample-002157,he came to understand its dodges and tricks and to accept it as it was
sample-002168,what had been next to him five minutes ago was now at the other side
sample-002169,he remembered something his grandfather had once told him that butterflies were a good omen
sample-002178,what had been next to him five minutes ago was now at the other side
sample-002179,the boy recalled the brilliance he had noticed on the previous day
sample-002180,the baby definitely has the sniffles
sample-002181,i am in search of that universal language among other things
sample-002182,neighbors moved away and there remained only a few small shops on the hill
sample-002183,the boy was trying to understand the truth of what the old man had said
sample-002184,the alchemist rode in front with the falcon on his shoulder
sample-002185,he approached the mass and was surprised at the size and the shape
sample-002186,but he didn't need to worry about that right now
sample-002187,at once he connected the two incidents
sample-002190,what have you done with them
sample-002191,he forgets the office when he's with me
sample-002192,did she ever marry the girl
sample-002193,the boy smiled and continued digging
sample-002194,the genies were the spirits of good and evil
sample-002195,the peak of this mountain is over two thousand meters above sea level
sample-002196,it helped me to trust in people the englishman answered
sample-002197,the boy was startled
sample-002208,don't say anything fatima interrupted
sample-002209,handle that with kid gloves
sample-002218,maybe it was yesterday
sample-002219,and tomorrow his enemy would also be a part of that soul
sample-002220,where's ashley's wallet
sample-002221,i'm a desert woman and i'm proud of that
sample-002222,i don't care what you say
sample-002223,he didn't know the man yet but his practiced eye would recognize him when he appeared
sample-002224,the englishman prodded him and the boy asked her about the man who cured people's illnesses
sample-002225,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
sample-002226,as independent studies document the neanderthals developed simple tools such as spears
sample-002227,he was immensely excited at the news
sample-002230,the boy told him then that he needed to get to the pyramids
sample-002231,thank you for reading this out loud
sample-002232,then suddenly he noticed it with a start
sample-002233,it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
sample-002234,well what good would it be to you if you had t die the alchemist answered
sample-002235,it was very hard for her to focus
sample-002236,i didn't do it
sample-002237,who's this gal she's gonna marry
sample-002240,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
sample-002241,it wasn't there
sample-002242,and don't pull that on me neither
sample-002243,something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top
sample-002244,my seven year resume gap is marked not drugs
sample-002245,flowers or another magazine subscription
sample-002246,don't let them see that you're afraid the alchemist said
sample-002247,three days from now he would be with the merchant's daughter
sample-002248,only in that way would he be able to read the omens
sample-002249,my seven year resume gap is marked not drugs
sample-002250,i'm going with you the boy said
sample-002251,have you got it
sample-002252,i'm an old superstitious arab and i believe in our proverbs
sample-002253,they provided warnings about thieves and barbarian tribes
sample-002254,the incantation was written in italics
sample-002255,i don't want anything for myself
sample-002256,the wind has many names
sample-002257,i wished i had a light to smoke by
sample-002258,he noticed the unequal cooling of its surface
sample-002259,give me my book the boy said
sample-002260,would you like a cappuccino
sample-002261,a large piece suddenly came off and fell with a loud and sharp noise
sample-002262,they placed it in a wooden box and left it there for good
sample-002263,you got to help us
sample-002264,but this payment goes well beyond my generosity the monk responded
sample-002265,the boy stood up shakily and looked once more at the pyramids
sample-002266,but just before lunchtime a boy stopped in front of the shop
sample-002267,on top of all that the weeds keep growing and the garbage has to be taken out
sample-002268,one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
sample-002269,i'm so hungry i could faint
sample-002270,and at that i told him and he took my place
sample-002271,you got someplace to sleep
sample-002272,it spread through the planet's atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features
sample-002273,it spread through the planet's atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features
sample-002274,the monk laughed when he saw me come back in tatters
sample-002275,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
sample-002276,perhaps she met somebody
sample-002277,from that day on it was the desert that would be important
sample-002278,if you pay attention to the present you can improve upon it
sample-002279,i'm just a fool
sample-002280,i'll take mine now
sample-002281,the boy laughed  out of happiness
sample-002282,we don't know what's in the confounded thing do you
sample-002283,the boy was suddenly happy to be there at the warehouse
sample-002284,after all who doesnt want to overcome new challenges and achieve great heights
sample-002285,and ask for a glass of wine for me
sample-002286,the stranger was speaking of things that very few people knew about
sample-002287,he fell asleep and when he awoke the sun was already high
sample-002288,how much is your equity in it
sample-002289,is there a crowd in the street
sample-002290,the top had certainly ceased to rotate
sample-002291,the line forms on the right
sample-002292,tell them mrs craig is here
sample-002293,throughout the night the boy dug at the place he had chosen but found nothing
sample-002294,dense clouds of smoke or dust can be seen through a powerful telescope
sample-002295,the shop was busy and the man asked the shepherd to wait until the afternoon
sample-002296,she didn't have one
sample-002297,one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
sample-002298,at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
sample-002299,he disappeared into the tent
sample-002301,the boy's name was santiago
sample-002302,he decided to stay right there and await his return
sample-002303,it's not easy to find the philosopher's stone said the englishman
sample-002304,a current of love rushed from his heart and the boy began to pray
sample-002305,you must not let up even after having come so far he continued
sample-002306,i pointed out mars a bright dot of light
sample-002307,then he dropped his spade picked up his jacket and came out into the road
sample-002308,of course it is
sample-002309,i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
sample-002310,when did you get back
sample-002311,she must have known alex pretty well
sample-002312,the old man wore a breastplate of gold and he knew about my past
sample-002313,you can't offer me something that is already mine the chief said arrogantly
sample-002315,he moved about invisible but everyone could hear him
sample-002316,what is a foreigner doing here asked another of the men
sample-002317,the man was speaking the language of alchemy
sample-002318,so how will we name all these hurricanes
sample-002319,the tropic of capricorn is on the southern hemisphere of the earth
sample-002320,it doesn't have to rhyme
sample-002321,how do you like that
sample-002322,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
sample-002323,why didn't they wake me
sample-002324,inverse kinematics are a mathematical challenge for robot engineers
sample-002325,the following night the boy appeared at the alchemist's tent with a horse
sample-002326,enough said the boy
sample-002327,and better still to be alone with one's books
sample-002329,how can i ever face him
sample-002330,i had a momentary impulse to go back and help him but i was too scared to do anything
sample-002331,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
sample-002332,he didn't know the man yet but his practiced eye would recognize him when he appeared
sample-002333,from the railway station in the distance came the sound of trains ringing and rumbling
sample-002334,the fine manufacturing company was a bookkeeper for fourteen years
sample-002335,what's the world's greatest lie the boy asked completely surprised
sample-002336,but i didnt think that it contained any living creature
sample-002337,a large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered
sample-002338,instead the stranger lowered it slowly until the point touched the boy's forehead
sample-002339,the volume wouldn't increase much further
sample-002340,i would have won the junior olympics if not for those medaling kids
sample-002341,there were really i think two or three hundred people elbowing one another
sample-002342,now his intuition was that he had been right in coming
sample-002343,the boy didn't know what to say
sample-002344,of course the two were unable to do anything
sample-002345,remember to take your full course of antibiotics stopping early is dangerous for your health
sample-002346,and then he would ask us to go back to our easels and replicate all the techniques in one go
sample-002347,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
sample-002350,another dreamer said the ticket seller to his assistant watching the boy walk away
sample-002351,and one or two persons were returning
sample-002352,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
sample-002353,the proposed approach provides stateoftheart results at very low computational cost
sample-002354,the years of research the magic symbols the strange words and the laboratory equipment
sample-002355,they locked themselves in their laboratories and tried to evolve as gold had
sample-002356,i've got to go to him
sample-002357,some people prefer not to quantify their feelings that way
sample-002368,the book was written in spanish
sample-002369,it's called the principle of favorability
sample-002378,i had seen all that it would presently bring me
sample-002379,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
sample-002380,this peach tart is tasty
sample-002381,the sun thought about that and decided to shine more brightly
sample-002382,the only tribesman spared was the commander of the battalion
sample-002383,she hoisted up the pirate flag
sample-002384,i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
sample-002385,it's no miracle because i see it happen once every year
sample-002386,a boy came running towards me
sample-002387,how much is it worth
sample-002390,i'm not good enough to make this one up
sample-002391,i'd like you to take me there if you can
sample-002392,death doesn't change anything the boy thought
sample-002393,down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
sample-002394,it was glaringly hot not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind
sample-002395,they never found the secret
sample-002396,we want to see you
sample-002397,i thought you were chasing me
sample-002408,some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound
sample-002409,he had understood the story the old king had told him
sample-002418,it spread through the planet's atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features
sample-002419,what are they wearing now
sample-002420,strange images passed through my mind
sample-002421,there was no empathy for her now
sample-002422,i locked eyes with a fish in the tank
sample-002423,the animals were exhausted and the men talked among themselves less and less
sample-002424,to do that successfully i must have no fear of failure
sample-002425,so he could not be hasty nor impatient
sample-002426,this recording is corrupted
sample-002427,enough said the boy
sample-002430,i need to sell some wool the boy told the merchant
sample-002431,it'll do you no good
sample-002432,it was only when i got this close to it that the strangeness of it was at all evident to me
sample-002433,at the first glance it was really not very exciting
sample-002434,where's ashley's wallet
sample-002435,i want to get something out of it
sample-002436,would you like to see where i was tattooed
sample-002437,please don't make me
sample-002440,they say at patti's house he left two hours ago
sample-002441,i'm going to them
sample-002442,you can't believe it's not butter
sample-002443,the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
sample-002444,i was wondering if you could tell me a bit more about what it's like to live and work there
sample-002445,that couldn't be one of the matthew boys
sample-002446,i shall make us some ice cubes
sample-002447,without a single quiver
sample-002448,the boy was surprised
sample-002449,the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
sample-002450,it was a strange furnace fueled by firewood with a transparent flask heating on top
sample-002451,overall i'm happy with the new device enough that i ordered one for both home and work
sample-002452,i'm not going very far the alchemist answered looking straight into the eyes of the horsemen
sample-002453,i don't want to change anything because i don't know how to deal with change
sample-002454,the sunset faded into twilight before anything else happened
sample-002455,i thought she was dead
sample-002456,i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
sample-002457,he was immensely excited at the news
sample-002458,he was going to miss the place and all the good things he had learned
sample-002459,in his hand he grasped a snake by the tail
sample-002460,i'm the stranger around here
sample-002461,you can't go any farther one of them said
sample-002462,spotted dick is a classic british pudding
sample-002463,well then why did you let me do it the boy asked
sample-002464,you should see the other guy specifically how good at fighting he is
sample-002465,why don't you want me to see him
sample-002467,but then he stopped
sample-002468,we don't know when the war will end so we can't continue our journey he said
sample-002469,there were really i think two or three hundred people elbowing one another
sample-002470,don't say anything fatima interrupted
sample-002471,but i didnt think that it contained any living creature
sample-002473,there was very little talking
sample-002474,one of these days is tomorrow
sample-002475,the boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid responding to her question
sample-002476,his adversary had three respawns remaining
sample-002477,the lightyear is a unit of distance not of time
sample-002478,i've had this shop for thirty years
sample-002479,the thought was so dreadful to him that he forgot about the heat and went forward
sample-002480,the top had certainly ceased to rotate
sample-002481,some went away while i was there and other people came
sample-002482,the miner had abandoned everything to go mining for emeralds
sample-002483,the next day the boy returned to the well hoping to see the girl
sample-002484,the nearby city of ceuta had grown faster than tangier and business had fallen off
sample-002485,i was impatient to see it opened
sample-002486,there was a small building there with a window at which people bought tickets to africa
sample-002487,you don't have to be rich skinny popular or even own a cape to perform a random act of kindness
sample-002488,but my heart is agitated the boy said
sample-002489,first he had studied esperanto then the world's religions and now it was alchemy
sample-002490,you don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you
sample-002491,i locked eyes with a fish in the tank
sample-002492,everyone is just standing by the building waiting to get in
sample-002493,the merchant turned to a customer who wanted three crystal glasses
sample-002494,i wished i had a light to smoke by
sample-002495,turning off gadgets that are not in use can save a lot of energy
sample-002496,it was as if the world had fallen silent because the boy's soul had
sample-002497,the two walked out among the palms
sample-002498,there was a small building there with a window at which people bought tickets to africa
sample-002500,but he decided first to buy his bakery and put some money aside
sample-002501,if he hasn't he certainly has a telephone book
sample-002502,some of the presented conclusions are not supported by the reported results
sample-002503,see if we can move it
sample-002504,it was a useful reminder to complete the task
sample-002505,bert the cop was wounded in north africa
sample-002506,they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
sample-002507,my name is melchizedek said the old man
sample-002508,will you give me your blessing asked the boy
sample-002509,the italian got her words mixed up
sample-002510,some of the grey ash was falling off the circular edge
sample-002511,my wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red green and yellow signal lights
sample-002512,their faces were covered with the blue cloths and their eyes showed fear
sample-002513,i left my father my mother and the town castle behind
sample-002514,where do you live
sample-002515,for that price you might as well get the brand name cordless drill
sample-002516,the alchemist followed as the boy's horse ran for almost half an hour
sample-002517,it's too bad that he's quickly going to forget my name he thought
sample-002518,another dreamer said the ticket seller to his assistant watching the boy walk away
sample-002519,the two men exchanged some words in arabic and the bar owner seemed irritated
sample-002520,now i will drift gently off to dreamland
sample-002521,i got doctor bills to pay
sample-002522,the monk laughed when he saw me come back in tatters
sample-002523,maybe no one here knows what an alchemist is
sample-002524,hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after
sample-002525,if you tell me why you came here i'll show you the project i've been working on
sample-002526,i think we can do better after the boat sails
sample-002527,it's the master work of the alchemists
sample-002528,they called that discovery the master work  it was part liquid and part solid
sample-002529,i had a dream and i met with a king
sample-002530,his life and his path had always provided him with enough omens
sample-002531,he must know how to deal with the snakes of the desert
sample-002532,i can learn something from the desert too
sample-002533,my review of the sun one star
sample-002534,it doesnt count as screen time if it is a game
sample-002535,the ferry line is too long to consider taking it
sample-002536,the boy swore that every time he heard the alarm he would heed its message
sample-002537,my seven year resume gap is marked not drugs
sample-002538,there is only one way to learn the alchemist answered
sample-002539,of course the two were unable to do anything
sample-002540,it has happened many times before
sample-002541,what about higgins against becca
sample-002542,that sobered him a little
sample-002543,trying to improve the world by jumping up and down
sample-002544,he had no idea how he was going to transform himself into the wind
sample-002545,i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
sample-002546,the driver got knocked cold
sample-002547,but now the sounds inside had stopped
sample-002550,i have the diet of a kid who found twenty dollars
sample-002551,the young arab took out a book and began to read
sample-002552,but the boy was certain that he had been looking at them
sample-002553,they become a part of everything
sample-002554,sun is better than rain
sample-002555,the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
sample-002556,so now i'm a camel driver
sample-002557,my puberty was probably taxing for mommy and daddy
sample-002568,this jelly doesn't taste of limes
sample-002569,they were both silent for a time observing the plaza and the townspeople
sample-002578,yeah its definitely worth checking out especially if the pay is reasonable and the work is good for your career there was absolutely no reason for her to announce it to the entire company
sample-002579,it was the old man who spoke first
sample-002580,it spread through the planet's atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features
sample-002581,i'd like to join but nobody asked me
sample-002582,the night was warm and i was thirsty
sample-002583,what do you need
sample-002584,they rented a boat and went down the river
sample-002585,some of the grey ash was falling off the circular edge
sample-002586,a monk dressed in black came to the gates
sample-002587,many people in berkshire surrey and middlesex must have seen it
sample-002590,he knew all the fields and pastures of andalusia
sample-002591,some do come back
sample-002592,it was dropping off in flakes and raining down on the sand
sample-002593,i saw neil yesterday afternoon
sample-002594,you must not let up even after having come so far he continued
sample-002595,hundreds must have seen it and taken it for a falling star
sample-002596,coming home a party of tourists passed us singing and playing music
sample-002597,something terrible's happened to me
sample-002608,as soon as he saw me among the crowd he called to me to come down
sample-002609,by tomorrow they'll be calling me bruce baldwin
sample-002618,the alchemist was a bit daunting but as the boy drank the wine he relaxed
sample-002619,the merchant was silent for a few moments
sample-002620,children jumping in puddles
sample-002621,but you are forcing me to look at wealth and at horizons i have never known
sample-002622,the experience in the coffin was literally immersive
sample-002623,where do you come in
sample-002624,but horses tire bit by bit
sample-002625,i'm going home and see my wife and family
sample-002626,i was just asking
sample-002627,a steel framed table separated one half of the room from the other
sample-002630,he slipped on the stairs
sample-002631,finally a young woman approached who was not dressed in black
sample-002632,he noticed the unequal cooling of its surface
sample-002633,the sunset faded into twilight before anything else happened
sample-002634,but they were not there
sample-002635,the level ground was blackened as far as one could see and it was still giving off smoke
sample-002636,they formed heaps that are visible a mile and a half away
sample-002637,the boy fell to his knees and wept
sample-002640,he needs three days answered the alchemist
sample-002641,they seemed to laugh at him and he laughed back his heart bursting with joy
sample-002642,the agent secretly entered the embassy from the roof
sample-002643,please use normal slashes not backslashes
sample-002644,michael opened a browser and navigated to an anonymous search engine
sample-002645,the strange horseman drew an enormous curved sword from a scabbard mounted on his saddle
sample-002646,i'm not going very far the alchemist answered looking straight into the eyes of the horsemen
sample-002647,you don't have to be rich skinny popular or even own a cape to perform a random act of kindness
sample-002648,in some places the ground was covered with the salt of driedup lakes
sample-002649,i have already found my treasure
sample-002650,it was immediately apparent
sample-002651,we'll carry the desk over
sample-002652,and he wasn't faring much better
sample-002653,there's a bunch of autograph seekers out front
sample-002654,absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
sample-002655,by tomorrow they'll be calling me bruce baldwin
sample-002656,but only speak a word and my servant will be healed
sample-002657,now look what you did
sample-002658,looking through the telescope i saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet
sample-002659,you knew the whole story
sample-002660,he didn't consider mending the hole  the stones could fall through any time they wanted
sample-002661,why do they make things so complicated he asked the englishman one night
sample-002662,all that time the martians must have been getting ready
sample-002663,there were mountains in the distance
sample-002664,so he asked if the old man's blessing was still with him
sample-002665,from the railway station in the distance came the sound of trains ringing and rumbling
sample-002666,i was scared but wasted no time in going out and crossing the bridge to the sand pits
sample-002667,the apples are in the basket near the door on your way out
sample-002668,it was a useful reminder to complete the task
sample-002669,if someone isn't what others want them to be the others become angry
sample-002670,just tell them marge sent you
sample-002671,three armed tribesmen approached and asked what the boy and the alchemist were doing there
sample-002672,i've been to your house a hundred times
sample-002673,replace the ts in tim tebow's name with any other consonant to get a star wars character
sample-002674,the crowd swayed a little as i elbowed my way through
sample-002675,the first day passed
sample-002676,just handling them made him feel better
sample-002677,because life wants you to achieve your destiny
sample-002678,then he dropped his spade picked up his jacket and came out into the road
sample-002679,he wanted to tell him about fatima
sample-002680,i wish you wouldn't
sample-002681,the boy thought it a strange question
sample-002682,ogilvy watched till one and then gave up
sample-002683,you can't believe it's not butter
sample-002684,the boy promised himself that when he returned from egypt he would buy that sword
sample-002685,she likes you
sample-002686,he paid for the wool and asked the shepherd to come back the following year
sample-002687,i'll talk to you tonight
sample-002688,maybe that's why they always stay close to me
sample-002689,looking around he sought his sheep and then realized that he was in a new world
sample-002690,especially with an election coming up in a few days
sample-002691,everyone should have health insurance
sample-002692,they tell their incredible stories at the time when you want to hear them
sample-002693,no one paid any attention to the two travelers
sample-002694,if you know your heart well it will never be able to do that to you
sample-002695,i am following my destiny
sample-002696,i own my own house
sample-002697,then how do i know this is your office
sample-002698,we know what you're up to
sample-002699,it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
sample-002700,bacon pancakes and maple syrup is a hearty start to any day
sample-002701,the men were terrified at his sorcery
sample-002702,i'm beginning to think women make the best spies
sample-002703,yet each felt his heart beat a bit faster
sample-002704,but the crystal merchant had no choice
sample-002705,he listened to the wind and felt the stones beneath his feet
sample-002706,you will never be able to escape from your heart
sample-002707,her jeans have holes in them
sample-002708,it seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of here
sample-002709,now it will be with hope
sample-002710,i knows i'm a luxury
sample-002711,they might even have become friends but the englishman closed off the conversation
sample-002712,with the wars between the tribes it's impossible to cross the desert
sample-002713,the genies were the spirits of good and evil
sample-002714,henderson was taking it in
sample-002715,you and i aren't like hassan that rich merchant
sample-002716,he thought about asking him to give it back but decided that would be unfriendly
sample-002717,one must prepare for it
sample-002718,what do you do when you work
sample-002719,i'm going to go back to doing just what i did before the boy thought
sample-002720,i don't know if i'll be able to find life in the desert the boy thought
sample-002721,that's what i'm afraid of
sample-002722,the boy was shocked
sample-002723,what had been next to him five minutes ago was now at the other side
sample-002724,well he thought about that the old man said
sample-002725,hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after
sample-002726,that'll close my account
sample-002727,have liv call me in the restaurant in twenty minutes
sample-002728,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
sample-002729,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
sample-002730,was the doctor here
sample-002731,that's never happened to me the boy said
sample-002732,the end of the cylinder was still as ogilvy and henderson had left it
sample-002733,maybe this is an omen said the englishman half aloud
sample-002734,i'd like to change places with you for just one day
sample-002735,remember the interview i wrote with alice wellman
sample-002736,they reminded him of the old man
sample-002737,and he wasn't faring much better
sample-002738,much better said the old man
sample-002739,they mounted their horses
sample-002740,some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound
sample-002741,i had seen all that it would presently bring me
sample-002742,the desert was all sand in some stretches and rocky in others
sample-002743,they were given to me as a present by a king the boy said
sample-002744,don't they believe in angels
sample-002745,i have the diet of a kid who found twenty dollars
sample-002746,the alchemist was a bit daunting but as the boy drank the wine he relaxed
sample-002747,don't you want me to stay
sample-002750,albert didn't have a brother
sample-002751,not until the moon was high did the alchemist ride into view
sample-002752,the angel touched the man's shoulder and they were both projected far into the future
sample-002753,have you got a ring
sample-002754,yes or even search for treasure
sample-002755,the sunset faded into twilight before anything else happened
sample-002756,i've got the party here
sample-002757,we got orders to hold you safely in the branches of this pine tree
sample-002768,i don't want to rush you
sample-002769,your money saved us for three days
sample-002778,but i didnt think that it contained any living creature
sample-002779,ogilvy watched till one and then gave up
sample-002780,because the crystal was dirty
sample-002781,but i'm going to egypt the boy said
sample-002782,what are they doing the old man asked pointing at the people in the plaza
sample-002783,he's out duckshooting now
sample-002784,everything you need to know you have learned through your journey
sample-002785,but just before lunchtime a boy stopped in front of the shop
sample-002786,you guys wanna play some more poker
sample-002787,then i suggest you call one of them
sample-002790,he approached the mass and was surprised at the size and the shape
sample-002791,the boy laughed  out of happiness
sample-002792,it seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of here
sample-002793,don't let them see that you're afraid the alchemist said
sample-002794,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
sample-002795,the alchemist knocked on the gate of the monastery
sample-002796,get a tray for these great big important leaders
sample-002797,walking along in the silence he had no regrets
sample-002800,the boy thanked him ate it and went on his way
sample-002801,do you know that i threw it away
sample-002802,his life and his path had always provided him with enough omens
sample-002803,i guess you must think i'm kinda batty
sample-002804,i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
sample-002805,worked hard just to have food and water like the sheep
sample-002806,in one he had read that many years ago a famous arabian alchemist had visited europe
sample-002807,i need you to be spontaneous he asked me out to din din
sample-002810,what does that get us
sample-002811,you're playing with dynamite
sample-002812,when he speaks in our language i can interpret what he has said
sample-002813,we're going to shoot the works
sample-002814,upon returning to the wise man he related in detail everything he had seen
sample-002815,can i get a woot woot
sample-002816,please bring mama back
sample-002817,i can only tell you what i saw
sample-002828,maybe we'd better ask someone the boy suggested
sample-002829,can i get a woot woot
sample-002838,not until the moon was high did the alchemist ride into view
sample-002839,he wasn't asking for help
sample-002840,then a man approached
sample-002841,it's coming right over
sample-002842,the alchemist's words echoed out like a curse
sample-002843,there was a moment of silence so profound that it seemed the city was asleep
sample-002844,the tribal chieftains will appreciate what you do
sample-002845,the merry christmas wreath for the window
sample-002846,can't you read me
sample-002847,i don't know how to turn them into reality
sample-002848,says for us to go the limit
sample-002849,do geese always fly in that formation
sample-002850,the list was frighteningly extensive
sample-002851,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
sample-002852,the jacket had a purpose and so did the boy
sample-002853,and a million and one other things
sample-002854,was it my fault
sample-002855,the caravan began to travel day and night
sample-002856,this website needs more interactive elements
sample-002857,before the boy could reply a butterfly appeared and fluttered between him and the old man
sample-002858,i'm not going very far the alchemist answered looking straight into the eyes of the horsemen
sample-002859,i didn't mean to shoot him
sample-002860,hires two personal trainers and make one of them train the other one
sample-002861,but you know that i'm not going to go to mecca
sample-002862,why the shots stopped after the tenth no one on earth has tried to explain
sample-002863,men have never understood the words of the wise
sample-002864,he washed the detritus from his hair
sample-002865,but i found it difficult to get to work because of the investigations
sample-002866,the boy went to look for the englishman
sample-002867,there was a loud shriek from a woman standing behind us
sample-002868,the alchemist probably already knew all that
sample-002869,what's that book you've got there
sample-002870,can i get a woot woot
sample-002871,you're my daughter and i love you
sample-002872,the hand with the whip pointed to the south
sample-002873,no one seemed to have thought about it that night
sample-002874,i'm proud of you
sample-002875,trust in your heart but never forget that you're in the desert
sample-002876,now go upstairs and see what little christina wants
sample-002877,its time to save the internet  again
sample-002878,the old man leafed through the book and fell to reading a page he came to
sample-002879,yes or even search for treasure
sample-002880,the first day passed
sample-002881,so how will we name all these hurricanes
sample-002882,i wish they were too
sample-002883,he stood irresolute for a moment and then scrambled out of the pit
sample-002884,i want to see him do it said the chief
sample-002885,this morning i found a calculator taped to my wii
sample-002886,is he really supposed to read that many books on philosophy
sample-002887,i'm afraid it is important
sample-002888,you'll get your money in sixty days
sample-002889,you have no idea what's happened to me
sample-002890,if that guy lays an egg
sample-002891,one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
sample-002892,it'll do you no good
sample-002893,the hand with the whip pointed to the south
sample-002894,he picked up the two stones and put them back in his pouch
sample-002895,the boy spent a sleepless night
sample-002896,there were just drawings coded instructions and obscure texts
sample-002897,it was bunched up and he had hardly thought of it for a long time
sample-002898,it was the time of day when all of spain slept during the summer
sample-002899,it's too bad that he's quickly going to forget my name he thought
sample-002900,your son went to serve at a distant place and became a centurion
sample-002901,the problem is that they don't even realize that they're walking a new road every day
sample-002902,that first day everyone slept from exhaustion including the englishman
sample-002903,mother's on the extension
sample-002904,what are you doing on this fine day
sample-002905,men have never understood the words of the wise
sample-002906,more good luck telegrams
sample-002907,did you say a king he asked
sample-002908,i felt like bruce wayne building his batcave
sample-002909,he's the man the ads are written for
sample-002910,my tax dollars pay for those public school proms
sample-002911,and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
sample-002912,come on in the office here
sample-002913,it's extremely suspicious that there's no information about brains that didn't come from a brain
sample-002914,only the lights in the great tent remained
sample-002915,something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top
sample-002916,it took him a while to get to the office
sample-002917,has aunt stephanie come in yet
sample-002918,the wind told me that you know about love the boy said to the sun
sample-002919,he was planning as he left the bar
sample-002920,what do you know about that
sample-002921,henderson stood up with a spade in his hand
sample-002922,august may have ended early
sample-002923,his life and his path had always provided him with enough omens
sample-002924,the oxygen's only to help him till the doctor gets here
sample-002925,where do you live shouted the boy as the horseman rode away
sample-002926,he wasn't an alchemist
sample-002927,not even the tribal chieftains are able to see him when they want to
sample-002928,your son went to serve at a distant place and became a centurion
sample-002929,many telescopes were pointed at it
sample-002930,i'm the answer to your prayer
sample-002931,it's like the flight of those two hawks it can't be understood by reason alone
sample-002932,because my eyes are not yet accustomed to the desert the boy said
sample-002933,there were really i think two or three hundred people elbowing one another
sample-002934,the boy thought about the crystal merchant
sample-002935,i thought that everything i owned would be destroyed
sample-002936,my tax dollars pay for those public school proms
sample-002937,he suggested that the boy look around the palace and return in two hours
sample-002938,he'll be ready on time
sample-002939,then you taught me something of the universal language and the soul of the world
sample-002948,i have known true alchemists the alchemist continued
sample-002949,i'm leaving today said the boy
sample-002958,there's millions of ways
sample-002959,they shouted consolation and promises and went off back to the town again to get help
sample-002960,maybe tomorrow said the boy moving away
sample-002961,how is the weather ubuntu
sample-002962,there's one that says 'everything that happens once can never happen again
sample-002963,the two men hurried back and found the cylinder still lying in the same position
sample-002964,i'd love to see you try and convince them of that
sample-002965,an ultimatum from edward and this one's final
sample-002966,and i want you to know that i'm coming back
sample-002967,have liv call me in the restaurant in twenty minutes
sample-002970,wasting my time listening to this mad hatter
sample-002971,and he looked out over the desert that had brought him to the woman he loved
sample-002972,don't give in to your fears said the alchemist in a strangely gentle voice
sample-002973,then came the night of the first falling star
sample-002974,the englishman asked if they were in danger
sample-002975,you don't have to wait till january
sample-002976,some of the grey ash was falling off the circular edge
sample-002977,the boy looked out at the horizon
sample-002988,all that time the martians must have been getting ready
sample-002989,the wind told me that you know about love the boy said to the sun
sample-002998,kate frank's a baker
sample-002999,we'll carry the desk over
sample-003000,your appointment has been changed
sample-003001,sam's crazy about mick
sample-003002,i heard a faint movement under my feet
sample-003003,as the astronaut walked into the translucent pod it transformed into an opaque material
sample-003004,because you are trying to realize your destiny
sample-003005,how long is it
sample-003006,she'll see us through dinner
sample-003007,camels are traitorous they walk thousands of paces and never seem to tire
sample-003008,the boy remembered an old proverb from his country
sample-003009,i swear it on my mother's grave
sample-003010,how'd you get in here
sample-003011,so they think she left it with you
sample-003012,that hole in the wall was too small for him to fit through
sample-003013,nice to meet you
sample-003014,wear the blue one
sample-003015,the englishman was unable to sleep one night
sample-003016,i don't think it's very ethical reading other people's stuff
sample-003017,henderson stood up with a spade in his hand
sample-003018,i don't know how to explain it
sample-003019,toronto is a few miles away
sample-003020,when the lead had become liquid the alchemist took from his pouch the strange yellow egg
sample-003021,i have to separate out the sulfur
sample-003023,did you want to see her about something important
sample-003024,he looked like an arab which was not unusual in those parts
sample-003025,'everyone loved them and enjoyed them
sample-003026,i don't know why you boys are so good to me
sample-003027,hires two personal trainers and make one of them train the other one
sample-003028,we need to solve this problem fast
sample-003029,if you want it you must take it
sample-003030,i don't want to rush you
sample-003031,that's the man who knows all the secrets of the world she said
sample-003032,that's the point at which most people give up
sample-003033,he decided to spend the night there
sample-003034,an alchemist said the alchemist
sample-003035,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
sample-003037,i'm not afraid of failing
sample-003038,do you want to go to work for me the merchant asked
sample-003039,what do you know about it
sample-003048,the girl dropped the container and the water spilled
sample-003049,you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
sample-003058,and they attacked an empty tent
sample-003059,what was written on the emerald tablet the boy wanted to know
sample-003060,the alchemist followed as the boy's horse ran for almost half an hour
sample-003061,dee's house right now
sample-003062,but i sort of like him
sample-003063,but i'm going to egypt the boy said
sample-003064,then you'll die in the midst of trying to realize your destiny
sample-003065,he dressed in his arabian clothing of white linen bought especially for this day
sample-003066,the wind began to blow again
sample-003067,the vertex was out of alignment
sample-003070,i heard what you were talking about the other day with the alchemist the wind said
sample-003071,he moved about invisible but everyone could hear him
sample-003072,it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
sample-003073,many telescopes were pointed at it
sample-003074,from that day on it was the desert that would be important
sample-003075,he had no idea how he was going to transform himself into the wind
sample-003076,many telescopes were pointed at it
sample-003077,the englishman could not contain his excitement
sample-003088,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
sample-003089,you bet i will
sample-003098,christine valued her freedom and would never deny anyone that privilege
sample-003099,the land was ruined and i had to find some other way to earn a living
sample-003100,let him have everything he wants
sample-003101,you dominated those horsemen with the way you looked at them he said
sample-003102,the shepherd said nothing
sample-003103,i'm going to need it
sample-003104,the boy became fearful the omens told him that something was wrong
sample-003105,in biology we study plants and animals in their natural environment
sample-003106,sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
sample-003107,from there he could see africa in the distance
sample-003110,the tradition teaches men how to cross the desert and how their children should marry
sample-003111,and the girl pointed to the south indicating that it was there the strange man lived
sample-003112,they must be used to their new shepherd and have probably already forgotten me
sample-003113,i thought sure you'd remember me
sample-003114,there's a place to sit down
sample-003115,it was only when i got this close to it that the strangeness of it was at all evident to me
sample-003116,i admit that i'm an alcoholic
sample-003117,an huge hole had been made by the impact of the projectile
sample-003128,as if i had the money back in a safe
sample-003129,and then they want the person to change
sample-003138,she cried for an hour
sample-003139,i want to tell you a story about dreams said the alchemist
sample-003140,we dont want him
sample-003141,what're you trying to do
sample-003142,gypsies are experts at getting people to do that sighed the old man
sample-003143,your account's still here
sample-003144,he really was a king
sample-003145,that night there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet
sample-003146,i thought that someday i'd be rich and could go to mecca
sample-003147,the boy stood up shakily and looked once more at the pyramids
sample-003148,the idea is still good
sample-003149,april cuddled her lamb
sample-003150,rest well tonight as if you were a warrior preparing for combat
sample-003151,they're not worth much the englishman answered
sample-003152,we're not allowed to tell
sample-003153,we're just slowly plodding through some user interviews at the moment
sample-003154,now i'm beginning what i could have started ten years ago
sample-003155,they are not really friends they just work together and talk from time to time
sample-003156,the proposed approach provides stateoftheart results at very low computational cost
sample-003157,the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
sample-003158,albert didn't have a brother
sample-003159,you and i aren't like hassan that rich merchant
sample-003160,but he had to move on
sample-003161,come on in the office here
sample-003162,there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
sample-003163,the wind's curiosity was aroused something that had never happened before
sample-003164,the horse reared again raising a cloud of dust
sample-003165,people talk a lot about omens thought the shepherd
sample-003166,and so will you
sample-003167,he stood irresolute for a moment and then scrambled out of the pit
sample-003168,but use them to buy your flock
sample-003169,maktub thought the boy
sample-003170,i've already had that experience with my sheep and now it's happening with people
sample-003171,it could be computed in many ways which would give more or less equivalent results
sample-003172,the insurance was sky high
sample-003173,i don't like seals anyhow
sample-003174,when he was a child that man wanted to travel too
sample-003175,the old man returned the book to the boy
sample-003176,replace the ts in tim tebow's name with any other consonant to get a star wars character
sample-003177,do you know what's wrong with you
sample-003178,like eating or sleeping or like seeking love or finding a job
sample-003179,you have to cross the entire sahara desert said the young man
sample-003180,nobody's trying to put anything over on you
sample-003181,then the old man began to inspect the sheep and he saw that one was lame
sample-003182,there was no justification provided
sample-003183,the crowd on the far left seemed to get bigger and i heard now a faint murmur from it
sample-003184,night fell and an assortment of fighting men and merchants entered and exited the tent
sample-003185,the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
sample-003186,but they really don't know what they're saying
sample-003187,but he decided to take a chance
sample-003188,i've heard her speak of you
sample-003189,one afternoon they passed by the encampment of one of the tribes
sample-003190,what good is money to you if you're going to die
sample-003191,i pointed out mars a bright dot of light
sample-003192,they made the boy continue digging but he found nothing
sample-003193,the old man returned the book to the boy
sample-003194,the same book that taught me about urim and thummim
sample-003195,of course it is
sample-003196,the merchant looked anxiously at the boy
sample-003197,a ghostly figure appeared
sample-003198,there was a loud shriek from a woman standing behind us
sample-003199,for some reason we were blocked from entering
sample-003200,you can't believe it's not butter
sample-003201,the queen sampled the selection of cakes
sample-003202,the fine manufacturing company was a bookkeeper for fourteen years
sample-003203,why didn't you tell me
sample-003204,they're closing in on you
sample-003205,at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
sample-003206,the alchemist is two hundred years old the englishman had told him
sample-003207,the sheep will get used to my not being there too the boy thought
sample-003208,they provided warnings about thieves and barbarian tribes
sample-003209,he understands the forces of nature
sample-003210,or a man into the wind
sample-003211,it reminded him of the wool from his sheep
sample-003212,on the  o'clock train
sample-003213,the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
sample-003214,maybe the alchemist has never been in love the boy thought
sample-003215,it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience
sample-003216,it's called the principle of favorability
sample-003217,i myself heard nothing of that
sample-003218,the boy wanted to believe that his friend had simply become separated from him by accident
sample-003219,berlin can be so lovely this time of year
sample-003220,i came to tell you just one thing the boy said
sample-003221,he's doing it because it's what he wants to do
sample-003222,he didn't know the man yet but his practiced eye would recognize him when he appeared
sample-003223,i have had the same dream twice he said
sample-003224,i got a lot on my mind
sample-003225,look what the chronicle is running on laura ben
sample-003226,suddenly for no apparent reason the boy's horse began to slow
sample-003227,this convention is a natural
sample-003228,our merchants bought that man and brought him to egypt
sample-003229,i'm not working for any other paper
sample-003230,from then on he would make his own decisions
sample-003231,then came the night of the first falling star
sample-003232,the newspaper articles had prepared everyone for the reception of the idea
sample-003233,so what is salem like he asked trying to get some sort of clue
sample-003234,are you sure erik has our telephone number
sample-003235,looks like she can keep kathy's on her toes
sample-003236,what happened to your wings
sample-003237,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
sample-003238,everything in life is an omen said the englishman now closing the journal he was reading
sample-003239,then i don't get paid
sample-003248,i went swimming with dolphins yesterday
sample-003249,but the alchemist continued to look to the horizon
sample-003258,no one attacks an oasis
sample-003259,looking up he saw a pair of hawks flying high in the sky
sample-003260,your account's still here
sample-003261,i don't know why we don't all have pneumonia
sample-003262,coming home a party of tourists passed us singing and playing music
sample-003263,i'd like to have my robe
sample-003264,sidelights on sheriff hartman's manhunt
sample-003265,the top of the cylinder was rotating on its body
sample-003266,about an hour ago
sample-003267,she could still be alive
sample-003270,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
sample-003271,the boy preferred wine
sample-003272,it brought his heart into his mouth
sample-003273,i want my wife
sample-003274,just leave your card with the boy
sample-003275,the sun thought for a minute
sample-003276,she bought cucumbers at the marketplace
sample-003277,the crowd swayed a little as i elbowed my way through
sample-003288,i guess you must think i'm kinda batty
sample-003289,as the flag unfurled they all hollered like wild beasts
sample-003298,i'll see you after
sample-003299,well i'd like to see their land and see how they live said his son
sample-003300,pork cutlet is also very tasty but our religion does not allow us to eat it
sample-003301,do i look as funny as you do
sample-003302,the next day the boy returned to the well hoping to see the girl
sample-003303,don't you see what's happening
sample-003304,he started to read the book he had bought
sample-003305,to do that successfully i must have no fear of failure
sample-003306,where you got him
sample-003307,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
sample-003310,he lives at the alfayoum oasis his friend had said
sample-003311,where have you been for so long
sample-003312,if you start your emails with greetings let me be the first to welcome you to earth
sample-003313,the boy trusted his new friend
sample-003314,you brought a new feeling into my crystal shop
sample-003315,please use your turn signal
sample-003316,he told me i should try to do so
sample-003317,the old man wore a breastplate of heavy gold covered with precious stones
sample-003328,he dressed in his arabian clothing of white linen bought especially for this day
sample-003329,they continued across the desert
sample-003338,i'd know that voice anywhere
sample-003339,you know it is
sample-003340,i'd know that voice anywhere
sample-003341,how do you handle the negative weights
sample-003342,the conversation was interrupted by the warehouse boss
sample-003343,and they had understood each other perfectly well
sample-003344,it was the old man who spoke first
sample-003345,well interpret the dream he said
sample-003346,the boy awoke before dawn
sample-003347,the boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid responding to her question
sample-003348,i am here the boy said
sample-003349,wait till those two future jailbirds read the morning post tomorrow
sample-003350,i beg of you not to do this thing
sample-003351,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
sample-003352,fatima the girl said averting her eyes
sample-003353,it was more activity than usual for this time of the morning
sample-003354,we were all made by the same hand and we have the same soul
sample-003355,we know that and we are used to it
sample-003356,i would if i thought i'd hear anything worth listening to
sample-003357,where are you from the boy asked
sample-003358,coming home a party of tourists passed us singing and playing music
sample-003359,he was more confident in himself though and felt as though he could conquer the world
sample-003360,the police have kindly provided us with a list
sample-003361,the boy listened quietly
sample-003362,then he took from his knapsack a bottle of wine and drank some
sample-003363,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
sample-003364,has aunt stephanie come in yet
sample-003365,hitting the delete and escape keys did nothing
sample-003366,he appeared with the first stars of evening
sample-003367,june decided to retire
sample-003368,eric took his vitamins and continued his exercise regime
sample-003369,i'm the king of salem the old man had said
sample-003370,it was faintly marked with transverse stripes and slightly flattened from the perfect round
sample-003371,the sun thought for a minute
sample-003372,she had pneumonia once
sample-003373,from the railway station in the distance came the sound of trains ringing and rumbling
sample-003374,that's never happened to me the boy said
sample-003375,he left without saying goodbye to the crystal merchant
sample-003376,you bet i've got a better offer
sample-003377,i kept my eyes fixed on the cylinder and began pushing my way back from the edge of the pit
sample-003378,i don't understand what you're talking about the desert said
sample-003379,henderson went into the railway station to telegraph the news to london
sample-003380,wait just a minute now
sample-003381,can i at least keep the onion soup
sample-003382,as they browsed the store together
sample-003383,where your treasure is there also will be your heart the alchemist had told him
sample-003384,it's called the principle of favorability
sample-003385,the heather was on fire and you could see a thin blue smoke rising up slowly
sample-003386,the tribal chieftains will see that and you'll be dismissed from your position as counselor
sample-003387,i can always go back to being a shepherd the boy thought
sample-003388,lioness rushes to defense of cub
sample-003389,get me my check book
sample-003390,it was impossible to remember all the details that he covered in an hour
sample-003391,it's the master work of the alchemists
sample-003392,make room for mrs chelsea
sample-003393,absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
sample-003394,he still calls his mother 'mummy'
sample-003395,i'll tell you what i'll do
sample-003396,but nowhere could he find his new companion
sample-003397,many people in berkshire surrey and middlesex must have seen it
sample-003398,but everyone and his aunt lilian's been through that bag
sample-003399,that florescent pink colour is hurting my eyes
sample-003400,gentlemen of the press
sample-003401,most of my friends have already finished college
sample-003402,but that's why you created the game in the first place the boy answered
sample-003403,i'm not going very far the alchemist answered looking straight into the eyes of the horsemen
sample-003404,as the sun rose the men began to beat the boy
sample-003405,i had seen all that it would presently bring me
sample-003406,abraham provided many treats
sample-003407,enough said the boy
sample-003408,i have watched the caravan as it crossed the desert he said
sample-003409,it was my fault for interfering
sample-003410,they were relieved and happy
sample-003411,the boy began again to read his book but he was no longer able to concentrate
sample-003412,the thought was so dreadful to him that he forgot about the heat and went forward
sample-003413,an huge hole had been made by the impact of the projectile
sample-003414,the city was still sleeping
sample-003415,are you going to listen
sample-003416,and a big turtle fell from the sky
sample-003417,what are you talking about
sample-003418,naturally we have to do something about it
sample-003419,now let's take a look at the candidates
sample-003420,bakers have homes while shepherds sleep out in the open
sample-003421,as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
sample-003422,where do you live shouted the boy as the horseman rode away
sample-003423,like eating or sleeping or like seeking love or finding a job
sample-003424,this was the strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space
sample-003425,you have been a real blessing to me
sample-003426,the night was warm and i was thirsty
sample-003427,everyone seemed very excited
sample-003428,he couldn't have been wrong
sample-003429,don't you see what's happening
sample-003430,i can work for the rest of today the boy answered
sample-003431,the boy and the englishman had bought camels and climbed uncertainly onto their backs
sample-003432,i think i will
sample-003433,there must be some way
sample-003434,the heather was on fire and you could see a thin blue smoke rising up slowly
sample-003435,it brought his heart into his mouth
sample-003436,his eyes filled with tears as he spoke of the prophet
sample-003437,it's true life really is generous to those who pursue their destiny the boy thought
sample-003438,a tow truck came to clear up the wreckage
sample-003439,you'll watch them as they grow demonstrating how the world is always changing
sample-003448,ogilvy watched till one and then gave up
sample-003449,they're closing in on you
sample-003458,henderson went into the railway station to telegraph the news to london
sample-003459,he picked up the two stones and put them back in his pouch
sample-003460,the boy smiled to himself
sample-003461,i'm afraid that if my dream is realized i'll have no reason to go on living
sample-003462,gotta be gentle to suit me
sample-003463,then he sat in the sunfilled doorway smoking the hookah
sample-003464,my phone is in my back pocket
sample-003465,but there was something there in his heart that wouldn't allow him to do so
sample-003466,it seemed as if what the old king had called beginner's luck were no longer functioning
sample-003467,maybe these desert birds could explain to him the meaning of love without ownership
sample-003470,the steel of its blade glittered in the light of the moon
sample-003471,she went over to the hospital to call on professor davis
sample-003472,he approached the mass and was surprised at the size and the shape
sample-003473,but everyone and his aunt lilian's been through that bag
sample-003474,i don't want anything for myself
sample-003475,the boy was astonished by what he saw inside
sample-003476,dont ever leave your hammer on the top of the ladder i said
sample-003477,on the third day the chief met with his officers
sample-003488,even me  i haven't thought of other women since i met the merchant's daughter
sample-003489,the boy was sad as he left her that day
sample-003498,alfayoum is in egypt said the arab
sample-003499,my wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red green and yellow signal lights
sample-003500,that's why i'm here
sample-003501,are you going to listen
sample-003502,i know good crystal from bad and everything else there is to know about crystal
sample-003503,and what's the matter with a thousand dollars
sample-003504,down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
sample-003505,you'll see a lot of strange things from now on
sample-003506,at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars
sample-003507,don't tell me what to do
sample-003510,i have the diet of a kid who found twenty dollars
sample-003511,a current of love rushed from his heart and the boy began to pray
sample-003512,samantha's boots felt heavy and her chest was tightening
sample-003513,i'd hate to have that many pins stuck in me
sample-003514,and the hero has slain the giant dragon
sample-003515,i know what it's going to be like
sample-003516,his name is barry baldwin
sample-003517,i accuse this man of being a faker
sample-003528,it was starlight and i explained the signs of the zodiac to her
sample-003529,we want you to know that we're all for you
sample-003538,in his hand he grasped a snake by the tail
sample-003539,the guitar broke and she couldn't play anymore
sample-003540,i have watched the caravan as it crossed the desert he said
sample-003541,kelly was interested in clearing up her brother's death
sample-003542,a shepherd may like to travel but he should never forget about his sheep
sample-003543,she would never know the difference because she didn't know how to read
sample-003544,he didn't want to cry with the other people there
sample-003545,and he wasn't faring much better
sample-003546,the shower curtain is beige and white
sample-003547,and a whole cold chicken staring us right in the face
sample-003548,maktub thought the boy
sample-003549,i wanted to sleep a little longer he thought
sample-003550,throughout the entire day we will be on the lookout for our enemies
sample-003551,using script blockers is generally a good idea but it requires the user to learn a bit
sample-003552,there were raised voicesand some sort of struggle appeared to be going on 
sample-003553,it's like the camel driver said 'eat when it's time to eat
sample-003554,now i will drift gently off to dreamland
sample-003555,the flight attendant winked at the obnoxious passenger seated next to me
sample-003556,we don't know when the war will end so we can't continue our journey he said
sample-003557,what are you doing here one of the figures demanded
sample-003558,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
sample-003559,it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
sample-003560,like everybody learns he said
sample-003561,as nice as blake's
sample-003562,she decided against it
sample-003563,mine's in the door
sample-003564,it seems old and wise
sample-003565,they'd never let you go
sample-003566,i swear it on my mother's grave
sample-003567,the merchant was silent for a few moments
sample-003568,if i was at a party where there was drinking involved i could call him and he would come pick me up and take me home
sample-003569,the two were taken to a nearby military camp
sample-003570,tomorrow morning at ten o'clock
sample-003571,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
sample-003572,they walked in from the rain all dishevelled and steaming
sample-003573,after all what he had always wanted was just that to know new places
sample-003574,i didn't know shepherds knew how to read said a girl's voice behind him
sample-003575,but those who know about such things would know that those are urim and thummim
sample-003576,the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees
sample-003577,the girl dropped the container and the water spilled
sample-003578,my friend said i love you
sample-003579,from here on you will be alone the alchemist said
sample-003580,when i returned to the common the sun was setting
sample-003581,gypsies are experts at getting people to do that sighed the old man
sample-003582,of course the two were unable to do anything
sample-003583,i had seen all that it would presently bring me
sample-003584,they crossed the desert for another two days in silence
sample-003585,the pixel probabilities are conditioned on the model state
sample-003586,the emerald tablet is a direct passage to the soul of the world
sample-003587,in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
sample-003588,and then i'm going to build things
sample-003589,the experience in the coffin was literally immersive
sample-003590,the merchants were assembling their stalls and the boy helped a candy seller to do his
sample-003591,now what do you say
sample-003592,but you know that i'm not going to go to mecca
sample-003593,once to the thief and once to the general
sample-003594,to keep on pitching
sample-003595,your heart is alive
sample-003596,if i don't find it i can always go home
sample-003597,the ceiling collapsed inwards
sample-003598,i am following my destiny
sample-003599,the boy listened quietly
sample-003600,alison couldn't help but feel pride in her creation
sample-003601,servants came and went with silver trays laden with spices and tea
sample-003602,the boy felt ill and terribly alone
sample-003603,fresh coffee is much better than the freeze dried stuff
sample-003604,it turned out to be a bitter tea
sample-003605,aren't you allowed to kiss back
sample-003606,we can't leave greg here
sample-003607,the boy offered his bottle hoping that the old man would leave him alone
sample-003608,when i'm eating that's all i think about
sample-003609,scattered groups of people were hurrying from the direction of woking
sample-003610,there is no wine in this country the young man said
sample-003611,we're refugees from the tribal wars and we need money the other figure said
sample-003612,it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-003613,i ain't seen him for a week
sample-003614,i'm going to them
sample-003615,at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
sample-003616,he told fatima that at their next meeting
sample-003617,all that time the martians must have been getting ready
sample-003618,since the miner had sacrificed everything to his destiny the old man decided to become involved
sample-003619,he appeared with the first stars of evening
sample-003620,we returned to the cemetery
sample-003621,who'd you say was gonna get him
sample-003622,now let's see what you look like when you protest
sample-003623,bert the cop was wounded in north africa
sample-003624,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
sample-003625,i beg of you not to do this thing
sample-003626,what would you do
sample-003627,is there a crowd in the street
sample-003628,you're losing your eye
sample-003629,some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound
sample-003630,no hope no adventure no old kings or destinies no treasure and no pyramids
sample-003631,your father's had a stroke of luck
sample-003632,they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
sample-003633,i beg your pardon
sample-003634,he suggested that the boy look around the palace and return in two hours
sample-003635,a fine bunch of reporters
sample-003636,when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
sample-003637,the suspension bridge was swinging in the gale
sample-003638,that's true enough the boy thought ruefully
sample-003639,so he asked if the old man's blessing was still with him
sample-003648,and then i'm going to build things
sample-003649,don't tell me you didn't know it was loaded
sample-003658,some place to live
sample-003659,i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
sample-003660,the men fell into an animated discussion
sample-003661,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
sample-003662,having heard that the boy became even more interested in alchemy
sample-003663,and now it was only four days before he would be back in that same village
sample-003664,even me  i haven't thought of other women since i met the merchant's daughter
sample-003665,that might be all right
sample-003666,he loosened the reins on his horse who galloped forward over the rocks and sand
sample-003667,the queen sampled the selection of cakes
sample-003670,he's on the way
sample-003671,you don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you
sample-003672,they begin creeping up on you trying to sell you something
sample-003673,the desert was all sand in some stretches and rocky in others
sample-003674,on the seventh day the alchemist decided to make camp earlier than usual
sample-003675,they began to ride out over the sands with the moon lighting their way
sample-003676,at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
sample-003677,it turned out to be a bitter tea
sample-003688,you have helped me the man continued to prepare his tea saying nothing
sample-003689,she would never know the difference because she didn't know how to read
sample-003698,go back to watching the caravan he said
sample-003699,the boy reached the small abandoned church just as night was falling
sample-003700,the old man wore a breastplate of gold and he knew about my past
sample-003701,i could die happily and that made me feel good
sample-003702,what about the blue one
sample-003703,i waited all afternoon and evening he said
sample-003704,and he decided he would go to see the chiefs of the tribes
sample-003705,you look at me as if you didn't know me
sample-003706,don't let her shoot
sample-003707,that night he told all of this to the alchemist
sample-003710,dense clouds of smoke or dust can be seen through a powerful telescope
sample-003711,golden penguins are so last season
sample-003712,the war continued and at times the wind carried the sweet sickly smell of blood
sample-003713,the idea frightened him
sample-003714,but there's a tribal war the boy reiterated
sample-003715,but use them to buy your flock
sample-003716,replace the ts in tim tebow's name with any other consonant to get a star wars character
sample-003717,all who went there were happy at having done so
sample-003728,same way you did
sample-003729,goats always have a better view
sample-003738,that's not true the boy said
sample-003739,dense clouds of smoke or dust can be seen through a powerful telescope
sample-003740,that sobered him a little
sample-003741,i'll be right with you
sample-003742,i shall make us some ice cubes
sample-003743,even though the sheep didn't teach me to speak arabic
sample-003745,yet each felt his heart beat a bit faster
sample-003746,what a wonderful weather
sample-003747,they continued across the desert
sample-003748,much better said the old man
sample-003749,so he could not be hasty nor impatient
sample-003751,it was faintly marked with transverse stripes and slightly flattened from the perfect round
sample-003752,it's the other foreigner the englishman
sample-003753,goodbye said the boy
sample-003754,before the boy could reply a butterfly appeared and fluttered between him and the old man
sample-003755,a line of flame high can be seen in the atmosphere
sample-003756,i like icecream
sample-003757,that's a good luck omen the englishman said after the fat arab had gone out
sample-003758,on the  o'clock train
sample-003759,then he realized that he had been distracted for a few moments looking at the sword
sample-003760,the tradition teaches men how to cross the desert and how their children should marry
sample-003761,it was however still so hot from its flight through the air
sample-003762,but he granted the travelers three days
sample-003763,i waited all afternoon and evening he said
sample-003764,this morning i found a calculator taped to my wii
sample-003765,'and this is what your son said' the angel told the man
sample-003766,the cinema was abandoned
sample-003767,one by one the campfires were extinguished and the oasis fell as quiet as the desert
sample-003768,alison couldn't help but feel pride in her creation
sample-003769,the boy spent a sleepless night
sample-003770,of course the two were unable to do anything
sample-003771,it turned out to be a bitter tea
sample-003772,some of the grey ash was falling off the circular edge
sample-003773,he asked it please never to stop speaking to him
sample-003774,every day was there to be lived or to mark one's departure from this world
sample-003775,only when he himself reveals it
sample-003776,love is the falcon's flight over your sands
sample-003777,didn't you tell her
sample-003779,of course the two were unable to do anything
sample-003780,he was able to get on his knees but he quickly slipped back
sample-003781,there were just drawings coded instructions and obscure texts
sample-003782,i don't know how to turn them into reality
sample-003783,the strange horseman drew an enormous curved sword from a scabbard mounted on his saddle
sample-003784,he's followed every game and his mouth's watering
sample-003785,we've got something a whole lot bigger than that
sample-003786,but he didn't stop
sample-003788,the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
sample-003789,well it's a long list
sample-003790,this is the mayor
sample-003791,i'm an old superstitious arab and i believe in our proverbs
sample-003792,the train pulled into the station
sample-003794,but we could sell tea in crystal glasses
sample-003795,listen to that mob
sample-003796,the battles may last for a long time perhaps even years
sample-003797,tomorrow at this same time bring me a tenth of your flock
sample-003798,let me out of here
sample-003799,the next day he gave his son a pouch that held three ancient spanish gold coins
sample-003800,my tax dollars pay for those public school proms
sample-003801,i sold crystal and crossed the desert
sample-003802,breakfast is usually earlier than this she thought
sample-003803,she's good enough for me
sample-003804,you're not going anywhere
sample-003805,the idea frightened him
sample-003806,it always helps to be learning something new and exciting
sample-003807,what is the benefit of the method in terms of identification accuracy
sample-003808,it could be computed in many ways which would give more or less equivalent results
sample-003809,i don't understand what you're talking about the desert said
sample-003810,how to avoid a massive dieoff of the colony
sample-003811,absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
sample-003812,something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top
sample-003813,i'm going to find that damned alchemist the englishman thought
sample-003814,starting with his own
sample-003815,we've got to walk up to the tower
sample-003816,i can clean up those glasses in the window if you want said the boy
sample-003817,he thought of all the married shepherds he had known
sample-003818,so when i look out over your sands i am also looking at her
sample-003819,except for the dream
sample-003820,scattered groups of people were hurrying from the direction of woking
sample-003821,i'm afraid that if my dream is realized i'll have no reason to go on living
sample-003822,it was something that i thought could happen only to others never to me
sample-003823,he paused and his eyes were still unfriendly
sample-003824,one million two hundred and fifty thousand dollars
sample-003825,down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
sample-003826,heads popping back behind doors
sample-003827,the review of related methods is simple to understand and informative
sample-003828,none of this ha d made an impression on the boy
sample-003829,jill caught the ball that peter had thrown towards her
sample-003830,it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-003831,but those who know about such things would know that those are urim and thummim
sample-003832,next you'll want to enumerate tabs so you can quickly jump between them
sample-003833,the top of the cylinder was rotating on its body
sample-003834,it's the only answer
sample-003835,of course the two were unable to do anything
sample-003836,arabs often appeared in the city shopping and chanting their strange prayers several times a day
sample-003837,as the sun rose the men began to beat the boy
sample-003838,i used to live near el cairum he said
sample-003839,most meteorites are more or less rounded
sample-003840,but he found it much more interesting to observe the caravan and listen to the wind
sample-003841,it must have fallen while i was sitting over there
sample-003842,get me my check book
sample-003843,among these people were a couple of cyclists a gardener i employed sometimes and a girl carrying a baby
sample-003844,which one are you
sample-003845,did you speak to mr norton
sample-003846,it's good to see you
sample-003847,the burning fire had been extinguished
sample-003850,at once he connected the two incidents
sample-003851,he quickly pulled his hands away
sample-003852,the brass lamp had been disturbed
sample-003853,worked hard just to have food and water like the sheep
sample-003854,i have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk which was embedded in the ground
sample-003855,'m all about those invisible cosmic connections that transcend time and distance
sample-003856,when i returned to the common the sun was setting
sample-003857,i waited all afternoon and evening he said
sample-003868,it seemed such a little thing so bright and small and still
sample-003869,when can i see him
sample-003878,a boy came running towards me
sample-003879,it was the devil
sample-003880,he was planning as he left the bar
sample-003881,reality was permanently scarred from those force field experiments
sample-003882,the day was dawning and the shepherd urged his sheep in the direction of the sun
sample-003883,the plumber tightened the leaking valve
sample-003884,he put a sign on the door and they went to a small cafe nearby
sample-003885,the greatest authority on meteorites stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles
sample-003886,it could get a whole lot worse
sample-003887,my wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red green and yellow signal lights
sample-003890,i pointed out mars a bright dot of light
sample-003891,and for wise men gold is the metal that evolved the furthest
sample-003892,i finally have enough money and all the time i need
sample-003893,sometimes their caravan met with another
sample-003894,take good care of him
sample-003895,sometimes their caravan met with another
sample-003896,wear the blue one
sample-003897,and yet none of these people has ever met the old king
sample-003908,gold would lose its value
sample-003909,they were people of the desert and clamored to hear his stories about the great cities
sample-003918,i found myself alone and saw the people on the other side of the pit running away
sample-003919,she was the one in charge of everything
sample-003920,that it was unable to deal with this boy who spoke the language of the world
sample-003921,somebody should eat the mango i guess it is me
sample-003922,fortytwo is not a random number
sample-003923,but fatima's hands held to the handles of her jug
sample-003924,how strange africa is thought the boy
sample-003925,it's not a battle of good against evil
sample-003926,had our instruments permitted it we might have been able to see the trouble way back when
sample-003927,he had seen the shooting star and was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere nearby
sample-003930,she was supposed to come down and get you
sample-003931,the next day the boy returned to the well hoping to see the girl
sample-003932,it wasn't there
sample-003933,love is the falcon's flight over your sands
sample-003934,this morning i found a calculator taped to my wii
sample-003935,the international space station is an awesome project
sample-003936,we want to see you
sample-003937,only you expected it to be like other marriages
sample-003940,i'm going to become bitter and distrustful of people because one person betrayed me
sample-003941,strange images passed through my mind
sample-003942,she says it's nothing to worry about
sample-003943,he had seen the shooting star and was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere nearby
sample-003944,don't you remember the home i promised you
sample-003945,you can only spit out so many seeds
sample-003946,what do you mean by that
sample-003947,as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
sample-003948,they were known as seers and they were held in fear by women and the elderly
sample-003949,it was glaringly hot not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind
sample-003950,they wanted to save the oasis
sample-003951,it was a strange furnace fueled by firewood with a transparent flask heating on top
sample-003952,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
sample-003953,we'll get you out in ten minutes
sample-003954,he had been to the village only once the year before
sample-003955,i'd like to live in it
sample-003956,he waited patiently for the merchant to awaken and open the shop
sample-003957,you don't call this a convenience
sample-003958,he sat on a stone and allowed himself to become hypnotized by the horizon
sample-003959,do you know someone here who cures people's illnesses the boy asked
sample-003960,the burning fire had been extinguished
sample-003961,he felt weighted down by the centuries of time since the pyramids had been built
sample-003962,help me the boy said
sample-003964,some of the grey ash was falling off the circular edge
sample-003965,i know its dimensions and how it behaves
sample-003966,he just got a new kite for his birthday
sample-003967,there was very little talking
sample-003968,i'm surprised the boy said
sample-003969,he put his headcloth in place and secured it with a ring made of camel skin
sample-003970,we lit the lantern and walked over to his house
sample-003971,after all who doesnt want to overcome new challenges and achieve great heights
sample-003972,i dreamt i was your father
sample-003973,even the guides spoke very little to one another
sample-003974,you were seen at the enemy camp three days ago
sample-003975,at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
sample-003976,never mind what desk
sample-003977,it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
sample-003978,by the light of their own destruction i saw them staggering and falling and their supporters turning to run
sample-003979,but they could never have taught him arabic
sample-003980,the boy had never even noticed that there was a hole in his pouch
sample-003981,he had been so far away that his face wasn't even visible
sample-003982,looking through the telescope i saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet
sample-003983,i'll tell you why they did it
sample-003984,even if you're an expert reading all of it is often not feasible due to lack of time
sample-003985,maybe he should not call people names that they don't want to be called
sample-003986,they don't see that the fields are new and the seasons change
sample-003987,it's up to you
sample-003989,and at that i told him and he took my place
sample-003990,he wanted to tell him about fatima
sample-003991,they reminded him of the old man
sample-003992,why didn't i call you back
sample-003993,can you imagine that
sample-003994,he thought of the merchant's daughter and was sure that she had probably married
sample-003995,during the third year the omens will continue to speak of your treasure and your destiny
sample-003996,it was faintly marked with transverse stripes and slightly flattened from the perfect round
sample-003997,i don't much like change he said
sample-003998,a large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered
sample-003999,she carefully removed the evidence from its packaging
sample-004000,life attracts life the alchemist answered
sample-004001,many people in berkshire surrey and middlesex must have seen it
sample-004002,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
sample-004004,the walls were covered with a thick paste
sample-004005,the boy was trying to understand the truth of what the old man had said
sample-004006,the terror was palpable
sample-004007,and yet none of these people has ever met the old king
sample-004008,i didn't want to marry anybody else in town
sample-004009,i bet it's a going away present
sample-004010,i'll work for you he said
sample-004011,there were mountains in the distance
sample-004012,isn't it all too wonderful
sample-004013,you can get around very easily by train  which is a very relaxing and affordable way to travel
sample-004014,the miner had abandoned everything to go mining for emeralds
sample-004015,i noticed that the boy answered
sample-004016,she doesn't know it yet
sample-004018,how did you learn to read the girl asked at one point
sample-004019,he noticed the unequal cooling of its surface
sample-004020,the clever men could be ignored
sample-004021,then he dropped his spade picked up his jacket and came out into the road
sample-004022,before this i always looked to the desert with longing said fatima
sample-004023,who says i can't
sample-004024,i don't know how to turn them into reality
sample-004025,all that time the martians must have been getting ready
sample-004026,c'mon over and join our party
sample-004027,so his heart was quiet for an entire afternoon
sample-004028,i saw astonishment and horror on the faces of the people around me
sample-004029,he told her about the morning's meeting
sample-004030,my brother just got the congressional medal of honor
sample-004031,if you know your heart well it will never be able to do that to you
sample-004032,because you have already lost your savings twice
sample-004033,this isn't for me to decide
sample-004034,too bad i couldn't see this guy first
sample-004035,because the crystal was dirty
sample-004036,i'm an adventurer looking for treasure he said to himself
sample-004037,opening the source code can be a measure to create trust in software
sample-004038,its observation probabilities are computed as a product of pixel probabilities
sample-004039,what he said reminded the boy of the old king
sample-004040,i'm not afraid of failing
sample-004041,i had a dream and i met with a king
sample-004042,you left out number five
sample-004043,no one seemed to have thought about it that night
sample-004044,the old man opened his cape and the boy was struck by what he saw
sample-004045,it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience
sample-004046,some place to live
sample-004047,last time i made the mistake of replicating a drawing by rodin
sample-004050,we don't know what's in the confounded thing do you
sample-004051,it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-004052,he was learning a lot of new things
sample-004053,he wanted to forget about the vision and return to his meditation
sample-004054,camels are traitorous they walk thousands of paces and never seem to tire
sample-004055,you hit my best friend
sample-004056,saul was infuriating the others
sample-004057,but can we trust him
sample-004068,a line of flame high can be seen in the atmosphere
sample-004069,looking through the telescope i saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet
sample-004078,the boy preferred wine
sample-004079,henderson stood up with a spade in his hand
sample-004080,how much is your equity in it
sample-004081,the two men exchanged some words in arabic and the bar owner seemed irritated
sample-004082,he was twenty minutes from his tent and began to make his way there
sample-004083,not always in this way but i always appear in one form or another
sample-004084,put jackie right on the staff
sample-004085,you can't believe it's not butter
sample-004086,he was immensely excited at the news
sample-004087,i don't know anything
sample-004090,bakers have homes while shepherds sleep out in the open
sample-004091,absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
sample-004092,now you just turn this way and go right straight down
sample-004093,at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
sample-004094,but his heart was speaking of other things
sample-004095,maybe tomorrow said the boy moving away
sample-004096,i've got to see nicole right away
sample-004097,why do they make things so complicated he asked the englishman one night
sample-004108,he tried again to concentrate on the pink shades of the desert and its stones
sample-004109,children jumping in puddles
sample-004118,much better said the old man
sample-004119,i was just in town earlier this year so it is kind of crazy to think about what took place right after
sample-004120,in alchemy it's called the soul of the world
sample-004121,one afternoon they passed by the encampment of one of the tribes
sample-004122,he was learning a lot of new things
sample-004123,it seemed such a little thing so bright and small and still
sample-004124,but the boy never took his eye off his new friend
sample-004125,the boy didn't know what to say
sample-004126,you wanna take this outside
sample-004127,do you know what cia stands for
sample-004130,but if you have to go before then go on in pursuit of your dream
sample-004131,be less complicated without a family
sample-004132,the lumberjack jumped up the tree
sample-004133,do you know what i mean
sample-004134,he almost began to tell about his treasure but decided not to do so
sample-004135,i should say not
sample-004136,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
sample-004137,but finally he agreed that the boy who spoke better arabic than he should do so
sample-004140,but he had to move on
sample-004141,the englishman could not contain his excitement
sample-004142,it seemed such a little thing so bright and small and still
sample-004143,storm increasing over the rockies
sample-004144,he was selling better than ever
sample-004145,they ate in silence
sample-004146,i want to stay at the oasis the boy answered
sample-004147,so it's better to listen to what it has to say
sample-004148,strange images passed through my mind
sample-004149,the boy didn't know what to say
sample-004150,i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
sample-004151,she improved her list every day
sample-004152,it seemed so safe and tranquil
sample-004153,but he found it much more interesting to observe the caravan and listen to the wind
sample-004154,it's called the principle of favorability beginner's luck
sample-004155,when he had completed the cleaning he asked the man for something to eat
sample-004156,the whole army of them
sample-004157,it's the only name i've got
sample-004158,it means only that the heart does what it can the alchemist said
sample-004159,at that point the omens will tell you that your treasure is buried forever
sample-004160,younger man what he had seen and the man asked him to wait there
sample-004161,the guy thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to stop him
sample-004162,the closer he got to the realization of his dream the more difficult things became
sample-004163,henderson was taking it in
sample-004164,she's good enough for me
sample-004165,in some places the ground was covered with the salt of driedup lakes
sample-004166,get me walter burns
sample-004167,i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
sample-004168,he was learning a lot of new things
sample-004169,there were raised voicesand some sort of struggle appeared to be going on 
sample-004170,i think i sprained my pride
sample-004171,you want the moon
sample-004172,don't say anything fatima interrupted
sample-004173,henderson went into the railway station to telegraph the news to london
sample-004174,i said i wish i'd never been born
sample-004175,at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars
sample-004176,he stood irresolute for a moment and then scrambled out of the pit
sample-004177,because you will never again be able to keep it quiet
sample-004178,what was all that
sample-004179,and also because i know about the soul of the world he thought to himself
sample-004180,how much is your equity in it
sample-004181,there was a murmur from the crowd
sample-004182,he quickly pulled his hands away
sample-004183,the camel driver understood what the boy was saying
sample-004184,love required them to stay with the people they loved
sample-004185,enough said the boy
sample-004186,i am following my destiny
sample-004187,but the englishman was exultant
sample-004188,then suppose you give me the money
sample-004189,the merchants were assembling their stalls and the boy helped a candy seller to do his
sample-004190,but they were not there
sample-004191,elizabeth reclined gracefully
sample-004192,this jelly doesn't taste of limes
sample-004193,and the alchemist understood that the boy's heart had returned to the soul of the world
sample-004194,people said that gypsies spent their lives tricking others
sample-004195,she refilled her vessel and left
sample-004196,the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
sample-004197,he could sell the stones and buy a return ticket
sample-004198,but the alchemist continued to look to the horizon
sample-004199,fastfood is convenient but often unhealthy
sample-004200,he had already seen many people come and go and the desert remained as it was
sample-004201,i know why i want to get back to my flock he thought
sample-004202,the toilet needed cleaning
sample-004203,so how will we name all these hurricanes
sample-004204,my seven year resume gap is marked not drugs
sample-004205,the land was ruined and i had to find some other way to earn a living
sample-004206,the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
sample-004207,worked hard just to have food and water like the sheep
sample-004208,why did we have to have all these kids
sample-004209,i'm going to them
sample-004210,as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
sample-004211,you should see the other guy specifically how good at fighting he is
sample-004212,an old man with a breastplate of gold wouldn't have lied just to acquire six sheep
sample-004213,the boy became fearful the omens told him that something was wrong
sample-004214,he had done this for years and knew the schedule of everyone who passed
sample-004215,the englishman vanished too gone to find the alchemist
sample-004216,just a memory right now it signified shade water and a refuge from the war
sample-004217,it drew a droplet of blood
sample-004218,so what should i do now the boy asked
sample-004219,the hand that evokes love and creates a twin soul for every person in the world
sample-004220,aldo and his grandma quickly discovered a new passion for coding
sample-004221,he was alarmed by what had happened
sample-004222,i hope he grows up to look like you
sample-004223,that was his work
sample-004224,well why don't we go there right now the boy asked
sample-004225,i'm hunting with my falcon the alchemist answered
sample-004226,she ought to be here any minute
sample-004227,that makes sense the alchemist answered
sample-004228,i saw the shopkeeper struggling near the edge of the pit
sample-004229,they mounted their horses
sample-004230,nearby was the englishman reading a book
sample-004231,i didn't need to waste my time just for this he said
sample-004232,then what's a big political boss like shiela daniels doing in town
sample-004233,she was reminded of her mistakes
sample-004234,who is this stranger who speaks of omens asked one of the chieftains eyeing the boy
sample-004235,the nearby city of ceuta had grown faster than tangier and business had fallen off
sample-004236,the concrete was covered in moss
sample-004237,only one third of the rubbish is being recycled in this country
sample-004238,for a moment everything was dark and scary
sample-004239,i heard a faint movement under my feet
sample-004240,there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
sample-004241,will i learn to do that someday the boy asked
sample-004242,something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top
sample-004243,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
sample-004244,if you're looking for a room there's no vacancy
sample-004245,but it is not a class that was requested by our alumni or prospective students
sample-004246,the end of the cylinder was still as ogilvy and henderson had left it
sample-004247,what time is it
sample-004250,this is for the boy
sample-004251,absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
sample-004252,it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
sample-004253,some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound
sample-004254,good luck to you
sample-004255,criminals cry for it
sample-004256,even though the sheep didn't teach me to speak arabic
sample-004257,i felt like being in paradise
sample-004268,the first day passed
sample-004269,i've been trying to figure it out
sample-004278,and because the tribes declared war i went to the well seeking the alchemist
sample-004279,i told you baldwin was in trouble
sample-004280,they eat lunch together often but dont really talk outside the office
sample-004281,they were inspired by that disaster to never let it happen again
sample-004282,give me my book the boy said
sample-004283,the alchemist removed the pan from the fire and set it aside to cool
sample-004284,and you married her
sample-004285,the one in there
sample-004286,and she already has her treasure it's you
sample-004287,we always observe the tradition
sample-004290,they're always after me for interviews
sample-004291,its been a long time since she last read chekhov and because of that she no longer feels like the heroine of her own story
sample-004292,who's down there with you
sample-004293,have you got my dough
sample-004294,just like an organ
sample-004295,an huge hole had been made by the impact of the projectile
sample-004296,they formed heaps that are visible a mile and a half away
sample-004297,and that's where the power of love comes in
sample-004308,all they ever do really is look for food and water
sample-004309,the angel touched the man's shoulder and they were both projected far into the future
sample-004318,they set off running wildly into the trees
sample-004319,but everything had changed
sample-004320,sometimes there's just no way to hold back the river
sample-004321,how do you feel
sample-004322,there were really i think two or three hundred people elbowing one another
sample-004323,stand by to contact amanda
sample-004324,air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
sample-004325,it's going to take a while the boy said
sample-004326,when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
sample-004327,i've got to talk to you straight from the shoulder
sample-004330,maybe she didn't even remember him
sample-004331,i'm a desert woman and i'm proud of that
sample-004332,not what you'd call rich
sample-004333,it's not a battle of good against evil
sample-004334,but here's the funniest part of it all
sample-004335,that's the first time you've been right today
sample-004336,then i suggest you call one of them
sample-004337,my sisters arent telling me everything i need to know to get there
sample-004340,that's a good luck omen the englishman said after the fat arab had gone out
sample-004341,the biggest living thing is a mushroom
sample-004342,i'm going to hate those who have found their treasure because i never found mine
sample-004343,they don't believe us
sample-004344,the boy smiled to himself
sample-004345,this is for the boy
sample-004346,the young arab took out a book and began to read
sample-004347,he was about the same age and height as the boy
sample-004348,so we their hearts speak more and more softly
sample-004349,a fine bunch of reporters
sample-004350,then suddenly he noticed it with a start
sample-004351,ask the owner of that stall how much the sword costs he said to his friend
sample-004352,but the marketplace was empty and he was far from home so he wept
sample-004353,i've been trying to figure it out
sample-004354,and he vanished around the corner of the plaza
sample-004355,at that point in their lives everything is clear and everything is possible
sample-004356,but bakers are more important people than shepherds
sample-004357,the boy had met the alchemist
sample-004358,but there were certain of them who took a bit longer to awaken
sample-004359,i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
sample-004360,he moved about invisible but everyone could hear him
sample-004361,can i go now
sample-004362,how are you
sample-004363,all i saw was an army said the boy
sample-004364,what do you need
sample-004365,this morning i found a calculator taped to my wii
sample-004366,but they really don't know what they're saying
sample-004367,the mixture took on a reddish color almost the color of blood
sample-004368,a large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered
sample-004369,everyone has his or her own way of learning things he said to himself
sample-004370,i just don't trust anyone who says they've never had hamburger helper
sample-004371,but it is not a class that was requested by our alumni or prospective students
sample-004372,at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars
sample-004373,but i didnt think that it contained any living creature
sample-004374,he took back his books and packed them away again in their bags
sample-004375,you'll wreck your raincoat
sample-004376,i'm doing much better and soon you'll be able to return to your sheep
sample-004377,but most important he was able every day to live out his dream
sample-004378,the achieved results are far behind the stateoftheart in image classification
sample-004379,it seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of here
sample-004380,maybe they're like me
sample-004381,it's no miracle because i see it happen once every year
sample-004382,he moved about invisible but everyone could hear him
sample-004383,i just know that the tradition is always right
sample-004384,now it will be with hope
sample-004385,but i found it difficult to get to work because of the investigations
sample-004386,it was impossible to remember all the details that he covered in an hour
sample-004387,and he asked the boy if he too were in search of the alchemist
sample-004388,when i returned to the common the sun was setting
sample-004389,but finally the merchant appeared and asked the boy to shear four sheep
sample-004390,it's a sacrifice we all ought to be glad to make
sample-004391,education is very important
sample-004392,i didn't know whose it was
sample-004393,i didn't come here to have you read my palm he said already regretting having come
sample-004394,they were both silent for a time observing the plaza and the townspeople
sample-004395,and one or two persons were returning
sample-004396,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
sample-004397,and i will tell you how to find the hidden treasure
sample-004398,his heart was heavy and he had been melancholy since the previous night
sample-004399,and yet none of these people has ever met the old king
sample-004400,artisanal gin bar seriously
sample-004401,i went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the dark
sample-004402,the sun thought about that and decided to shine more brightly
sample-004403,that's what she did to me
sample-004404,well then why do we need all these books the boy asked
sample-004405,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
sample-004406,bob lifted the dusty scroll
sample-004407,the authors claim to specifically address variations due to geometric transformations in the acquired images
sample-004408,pull this lever to activate the piston
sample-004409,we're just travelers the alchemist answered
sample-004410,i wouldn't be a bit surprised
sample-004411,we're refugees from the tribal wars and we need money the other figure said
sample-004412,and your camels will bring you wealth and power
sample-004413,in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
sample-004414,what's that got to do with it
sample-004415,you're not going anywhere
sample-004416,vibrations of peace throughout the tent
sample-004417,from that day on the oasis would be an empty place for her
sample-004418,i finally have enough money and all the time i need
sample-004419,she would never know the difference because she didn't know how to read
sample-004420,never mind the money
sample-004421,i want to see the chieftains
sample-004422,i need to sell some wool the boy told the merchant
sample-004423,i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
sample-004424,they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
sample-004425,that night there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet
sample-004426,show me where there is life out in the desert
sample-004427,did she discuss it with you
sample-004428,there were three hundred wells fifty thousand date trees and innumerable colored tents spread among them
sample-004429,the night was warm and i was thirsty
sample-004430,some people make the same mistakes over and over again
sample-004431,the genies were the spirits of good and evil
sample-004432,for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
sample-004433,you should show that your method improves results
sample-004434,but the boy knew that he was referring to fatima
sample-004435,the day was dawning and the shepherd urged his sheep in the direction of the sun
sample-004436,the boy was trying to understand the truth of what the old man had said
sample-004437,melchizedek watched a small ship that was plowing its way out of the port
sample-004438,meanwhile the old man persisted in his attempt to strike up a conversation
sample-004439,go back to watching the caravan he said
sample-004440,at the highest point in tarifa there is an old fort built by the moors
sample-004441,the stranger placed his sword in its scabbard and the boy relaxed
sample-004442,you wanna take this outside
sample-004443,the men climbed the hill and they were tired when they reached the top
sample-004444,she says it's nothing to worry about
sample-004445,they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
sample-004446,the old man was probably a gypsy too
sample-004447,give me that call on patrick's wire
sample-004450,i have to separate out the sulfur
sample-004451,so he could not be hasty nor impatient
sample-004452,no one can be from many places the boy said
sample-004453,we'll have to satisfy them
sample-004454,the alchemist followed as the boy's horse ran for almost half an hour
sample-004455,henderson stood up with a spade in his hand
sample-004456,but then i realized she couldn't have been
sample-004457,of course the two were unable to do anything
sample-004468,do you mind if we go someplace crowded
sample-004469,there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
sample-004478,i'd like to live in it
sample-004479,the silicon sealant has dried
sample-004480,this wedge prevents the trailer from rolling down the slope in case of brake failure
sample-004481,i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
sample-004482,the sheep had taught him that
sample-004483,in his heart he wanted to remain awake but he also wanted to sleep
sample-004484,they become the soul o f the world
sample-004485,it's a code said the boy a bit disappointed
sample-004486,the desert with its endless monotony put him to dreaming
sample-004487,what do you want here today the desert asked him
sample-004490,but there was a sixth day the sun went on
sample-004491,it's true life really is generous to those who pursue their destiny the boy thought
sample-004492,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
sample-004493,and my name's michael
sample-004494,about three years ago i set up dragon naturally speaking on my home computer
sample-004495,he had seen the shooting star and was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere nearby
sample-004496,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
sample-004497,suppose there was a shane york and he walked into this office
sample-004508,you can't offer me something that is already mine the chief said arrogantly
sample-004509,sometimes it's better to be with the sheep who don't say anything
sample-004518,it would have been visible to me had i only looked up as it passed
sample-004519,if it were he would already have heard of it
sample-004520,it would have been visible to me had i only looked up as it passed
sample-004521,my seven year resume gap is marked not drugs
sample-004522,but he had to move on
sample-004523,the boy continued to listen to his heart as they crossed the desert
sample-004524,will you put that thing away
sample-004525,his heart was heavy and he had been melancholy since the previous night
sample-004526,they were surrounded by children curious to look at the animals and people that were arriving
sample-004527,since the miner had sacrificed everything to his destiny the old man decided to become involved
sample-004530,with the girl with the raven hair his days would never be the same again
sample-004531,but horses tire bit by bit
sample-004532,but he certainly didn't desire that an army invade the oasis
sample-004533,first you need to install an extension that labels clickable elements on the page
sample-004534,can you imagine that
sample-004535,'m all about those invisible cosmic connections that transcend time and distance
sample-004536,i'll just go upstairs and send it over with a messenger
sample-004537,it was the levanter the wind that came from africa
sample-004540,even when all you want to do is travel
sample-004541,a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder
sample-004542,continue in the direction of the pyramids said the alchemist
sample-004543,you can also try open source clients but make sure to choose one that supports rootless mode
sample-004544,it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
sample-004545,only when he consents
sample-004546,i don't blame them
sample-004547,we want to see you
sample-004548,tomorrow sell your camel and buy a horse
sample-004549,about eleven i walked back to my home in maybury because nothing seemed to be happening
sample-004550,it could prove fatal for them as well as yourself
sample-004551,he was twenty minutes from his tent and began to make his way there
sample-004552,please don't be lazy
sample-004553,laura took out a cigarette and placed it in her mouth
sample-004554,it was due to her knowledge and experience that she solved the mystery first
sample-004555,maybe tomorrow will be better than yesterday
sample-004556,the boy smiled and continued digging
sample-004557,christine valued her freedom and would never deny anyone that privilege
sample-004558,like eating or sleeping or like seeking love or finding a job
sample-004559,well it's a long list
sample-004560,the old man gave a signal and everyone stood
sample-004561,how did you learn to read the girl asked at one point
sample-004562,i wish you every possible happiness and joy
sample-004563,so that those who have the responsibility for understanding can understand he said
sample-004564,just by looking at them
sample-004565,last week i went hiking in the mountains
sample-004566,they're not my children
sample-004567,the thought was so dreadful to him that he forgot about the heat and went forward
sample-004568,you got to help us
sample-004569,at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
sample-004570,dense clouds of smoke or dust can be seen through a powerful telescope
sample-004571,but he decided first to buy his bakery and put some money aside
sample-004572,which one of these men is it
sample-004573,i'm through listening to you
sample-004574,i'm going to take over a lot of plates and things
sample-004575,you can't offer me something that is already mine the chief said arrogantly
sample-004576,he won't leave the circle
sample-004577,and one or two persons were returning
sample-004578,i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
sample-004579,which view would you like
sample-004580,you must not let up even after having come so far he continued
sample-004581,who gets your vote
sample-004582,the boy was startled
sample-004583,my greatgrandfather planted this tree
sample-004584,imagine if everyone went around transforming lead into gold
sample-004585,he really was a king
sample-004586,proteins have many functions in the human body
sample-004587,april cuddled her lamb
sample-004588,you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
sample-004589,how do i guess at the future
sample-004590,i saw him get it
sample-004591,sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
sample-004592,a quarter of a million dollars
sample-004593,not even a stick of gum
sample-004594,the boy continued to listen to his heart as they crossed the desert
sample-004595,then the thing came upon him in a flash
sample-004596,go into your dance
sample-004597,i can't think of any reason why she was killed
sample-004598,if you start your emails with greetings let me be the first to welcome you to earth
sample-004599,sexuality is a mystery
sample-004600,because life wants you to achieve your destiny
sample-004601,the animals were exhausted and the men talked among themselves less and less
sample-004602,for a moment everything was dark and scary
sample-004603,then the thing came upon him in a flash
sample-004604,it commenced to blow harder raising the desert sands
sample-004605,he wanted your money he said
sample-004606,as they sat down at the only table in the place the crystal merchant laughed
sample-004607,finally after hours of waiting the guard bade the boy enter
sample-004608,the merchant was silent for a few moments
sample-004609,he was more confident in himself though and felt as though he could conquer the world
sample-004610,and this is for me said the alchemist keeping one of the parts
sample-004611,it's called the principle of favorability beginner's luck
sample-004612,but that's what you're doing
sample-004613,looking around he sought his sheep and then realized that he was in a new world
sample-004614,the englishman had been profoundly impressed by the story
sample-004615,it was a pleasant change from talking to his sheep
sample-004616,all i saw was an army said the boy
sample-004617,but i didnt think that it contained any living creature
sample-004618,he needed someone to talk to so as to avoid thinking about the possibility of war
sample-004619,think i'd better be going
sample-004620,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
sample-004621,it was as if the world had fallen silent because the boy's soul had
sample-004622,but the boy never took his eye off his new friend
sample-004623,the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
sample-004624,upon returning to the wise man he related in detail everything he had seen
sample-004625,well why don't we go there right now the boy asked
sample-004626,whenever he could he sought out a new road to travel
sample-004627,and then he perceived it very slowly
sample-004628,looking up he saw a pair of hawks flying high in the sky
sample-004629,it was up there
sample-004630,the irish man sipped his tea
sample-004631,so when i look out over your sands i am also looking at her
sample-004632,your heart is alive
sample-004633,so the boy was disappointed he decided that he would never again believe in dreams
sample-004634,i've been looking for you all morning he said as he led the boy outside
sample-004635,my name is melchizedek said the old man
sample-004636,the article references previous biometric work in a reasonable way
sample-004637,the horseman was completely immobile as was the boy
sample-004638,listen to your heart
sample-004639,i wanted to sleep a little longer he thought
sample-004640,i didn't frisk him
sample-004641,turn up the volume
sample-004642,got a lot of charm
sample-004643,they were strange books
sample-004644,it was only when i got this close to it that the strangeness of it was at all evident to me
sample-004645,he listened to the wind and felt the stones beneath his feet
sample-004646,the boy remembered his dream and suddenly everything was clear to him
sample-004647,they set off running wildly into the trees
sample-004650,you must always know what it is that you want the old king had said
sample-004651,the boy knew the desert sensed his fear
sample-004652,and they attacked an empty tent
sample-004653,the boy's name was santiago
sample-004654,robin had some sort of date with tracy
sample-004655,please don't make me
sample-004656,so that those who have the responsibility for understanding can understand he said
sample-004657,men dream more about coming home than about leaving the boy said
sample-004668,her honor won't say anything
sample-004669,the alchemist probably already knew all that
sample-004678,the boy noticed that the man's clothing was strange
sample-004679,he just got a new kite for his birthday
sample-004680,what do they want
sample-004681,suddenly the monster disappeared
sample-004682,i need to sell some wool the boy told the merchant
sample-004683,it means only that the heart does what it can the alchemist said
sample-004684,both elephants and monkeys have a capable memory
sample-004685,why didn't i call you back
sample-004686,the tradition teaches men how to cross the desert and how their children should marry
sample-004687,taking the jacket out he began to clean the glasses
sample-004690,i heard a faint movement under my feet
sample-004691,it spread through the planet's atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features
sample-004692,what's she saying now
sample-004693,people said that gypsies spent their lives tricking others
sample-004694,that day he didn't make a cast
sample-004695,i wish they'd stop that practicing
sample-004696,but the englishman appeared not to attach any importance to it
sample-004697,the horse reared again raising a cloud of dust
sample-004708,and this is for me said the alchemist keeping one of the parts
sample-004709,it was there that the wise man lived
sample-004718,i left my father my mother and the town castle behind
sample-004719,let me comb your hair
sample-004720,but i'm going in search of my treasure the boy said
sample-004721,that rollercoaster was insane
sample-004722,what was spoken was totally disregarded
sample-004723,he means that he can't really tell you the truth for pr reasons
sample-004724,he's home cooking dinner
sample-004725,exactly answered the alchemist
sample-004726,but they were not there
sample-004727,i've been lonely and hungry for something practically all my life
sample-004730,henderson was taking it in
sample-004731,he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
sample-004732,the boy remembered his dream and suddenly everything was clear to him
sample-004733,he wants me to write down only things that i think about but not things i plan to do
sample-004734,the next day the boy met the old man at noon
sample-004735,on the seventh day the alchemist decided to make camp earlier than usual
sample-004736,because of the omens the alchemist answered
sample-004737,and what do you do in salem he insisted
sample-004740,we're going to take her over to my private office
sample-004741,it brought his heart into his mouth
sample-004742,you put something wrong in those capsules
sample-004743,maybe because that wasn't really his dream
sample-004744,sometimes i appear in the form of a solution or a good idea
sample-004745,i need you to be spontaneous he asked me out to din din
sample-004746,there was very little talking
sample-004747,i'm going out and find them
sample-004748,it didn't even occur to the boy to flee
sample-004749,i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
sample-004750,she and the judge are like corned beef and cabbage
sample-004751,they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
sample-004752,it was the levanter the wind that came from africa
sample-004753,at once he connected the two incidents
sample-004754,as he did so he talked with the monk about the tribal wars
sample-004755,hires two personal trainers and make one of them train the other one
sample-004756,my review of the sun one star
sample-004757,we have also started contemplating the possibility of moving back to colorado
sample-004758,i don't want anything for myself
sample-004760,then came the night of the first falling star
sample-004761,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
sample-004762,but fatima's hands held to the handles of her jug
sample-004763,now i too will be one of the women who wait
sample-004764,i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
sample-004766,if we serve tea in crystal the shop is going to expand
sample-004767,that makes sense the alchemist answered
sample-004768,he was immensely excited at the news
sample-004769,the omens will begin insistently to speak of it and you'll try to ignore them
sample-004770,his eyes filled with tears as he spoke of the prophet
sample-004772,they're closing in on you
sample-004773,the people will enjoy the tea and want to buy the glasses
sample-004774,i went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the dark
sample-004775,you're the one who may die the alchemist said
sample-004776,i just don't trust anyone who says they've never had hamburger helper
sample-004777,but only speak a word and my servant will be healed
sample-004778,the man you had the fight with
sample-004779,i'm going to them
sample-004780,something bright reflected from his chest with such intensity that the boy was momentarily blinded
sample-004781,then taking his sheep he walked away
sample-004782,i have been wanting to go and waiting for him to go with me
sample-004783,there are a lot of powerful tools and libraries out there
sample-004784,one is loved because one is loved
sample-004785,we are obliged at least once in our lives to visit the holy city of mecca
sample-004786,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
sample-004787,i need you to be spontaneous he asked me out to din din
sample-004788,another hour to write it
sample-004789,there was absolutely no reason for her to announce it to the entire company
sample-004790,the top had certainly ceased to rotate
sample-004791,the soul of the world is nourished by people's happiness
sample-004792,crossing your own pals
sample-004793,but they could never have taught him arabic
sample-004794,ask the owner of that stall how much the sword costs he said to his friend
sample-004795,he followed the movement of the birds trying to read something into it
sample-004796,i came out of it without a scratch
sample-004797,after all who doesnt want to overcome new challenges and achieve great heights
sample-004798,and seizing the boy's bag the alchemist gave the gold coins to the chief
sample-004799,where'd you meet this man
sample-004800,watch over her tonight
sample-004801,i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
sample-004802,here it is again
sample-004803,like eating or sleeping or like seeking love or finding a job
sample-004804,at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars
sample-004805,you must understand that love never keeps a man from pursuing his destiny
sample-004806,that might be all right
sample-004807,that baker he said to himself without completing the thought
sample-004808,the horizon was tinged with red and suddenly the sun appeared
sample-004809,you'll get your money in sixty days
sample-004810,well he thought about that the old man said
sample-004811,they spoke about mercury salt dragons and kings and he didn't understand any of it
sample-004812,when the pan had cooled the monk and the boy looked at it dazzled
sample-004813,the infidels had an evil look about them
sample-004814,how did you learn to read the girl asked at one point
sample-004815,there the alchemist separated the disk into four parts
sample-004816,you have enough gold to buy many sheep and many camels
sample-004817,absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
sample-004818,i have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk which was embedded in the ground
sample-004819,the horseman was completely immobile as was the boy
sample-004820,i know it's soon to talk about it
sample-004821,the scabbard was embossed in silver and the handle was black and encrusted with precious stones
sample-004822,among these people were a couple of cyclists a gardener i employed sometimes and a girl carrying a baby
sample-004823,over here in the bushes
sample-004824,i've had this shop for thirty years
sample-004825,this farm had cattle chicken sheep and many other animals
sample-004826,during one of these conversations the driver told of his own life
sample-004827,i'd like you to take me there if you can
sample-004828,they'd never let you go
sample-004829,he had never even wept in front of his own sheep
sample-004830,they set off running wildly into the trees
sample-004831,everyone seemed very excited
sample-004832,he wanted to forget about the vision and return to his meditation
sample-004833,yet each felt his heart beat a bit faster
sample-004834,and my name's michael
sample-004835,he was just and good
sample-004836,go ahead and have your dinner
sample-004837,it was however still so hot from its flight through the air
sample-004838,on the very first page it described a burial ceremony
sample-004839,people from all over the world have passed through this village son said his father
sample-004848,but finally the merchant appeared and asked the boy to shear four sheep
sample-004849,it seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of here
sample-004858,a little token of appreciation
sample-004859,just beginning to get an idea what those things mean
sample-004860,it spread through the planet's atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features
sample-004861,how could it be awkward
sample-004862,at his side was the young arab the boy had spoken with earlier
sample-004863,everyone should have health insurance
sample-004864,the boy listened quietly
sample-004865,not everyone can see his dreams come true in the same way
sample-004866,she would never know the difference because she didn't know how to read
sample-004867,you are almost at the end of your journey said the alchemist
sample-004870,they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
sample-004871,then it became a signal of danger
sample-004872,the bank's going to reopen next week
sample-004873,the dead soldiers were replaced by others and life went on
sample-004874,you can't believe it's not butter
sample-004875,help me the boy said
sample-004876,add decade in the sun best of stereophonics to laundry
sample-004877,the end of the cylinder was still as ogilvy and henderson had left it
sample-004888,apple pie is an iconic dish
sample-004889,the stranger was speaking of things that very few people knew about
sample-004898,the boy was surprised
sample-004899,come into the office a minute
sample-004900,they reminded him of the old man
sample-004901,upon returning to the wise man he related in detail everything he had seen
sample-004902,the thief wasn't there and the owner brought him a cup of tea
sample-004903,much better said the old man
sample-004904,you'll watch them as they grow demonstrating how the world is always changing
sample-004905,explanations are illogical and confusing
sample-004906,about eleven i walked back to my home in maybury because nothing seemed to be happening
sample-004907,i'm a sucker for it
sample-004910,as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
sample-004911,an alchemist said the alchemist
sample-004912,want to give my flower a drink
sample-004913,the wind screamed with delight and blew harder than ever
sample-004914,i beg your pardon
sample-004915,it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-004916,i've got to talk to you straight from the shoulder
sample-004917,the terror was palpable
sample-004928,she cried for an hour
sample-004929,i don't want to rush you
sample-004938,why should i be in any danger
sample-004939,that night there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet
sample-004940,you're not asking a favor of him
sample-004941,the boy fell to the sand nearly unconscious
sample-004943,i've never had one before the merchant answered
sample-004944,i'll be next door
sample-004945,the boy was relieved
sample-004946,it was a surprise to me
sample-004947,this morning i found a calculator taped to my wii
sample-004948,he had seen the shooting star and was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere nearby
sample-004949,to measure the performance accurately we need a benchmark
sample-004950,he moved about invisible but everyone could hear him
sample-004951,my scholarship got rejected
sample-004952,they ate in silence
sample-004953,i think i sprained my pride
sample-004954,it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience
sample-004955,the boy closed his book
sample-004957,sometime during the second year you'll remember about the treasure
sample-004958,i should thank you
sample-004959,an huge hole had been made by the impact of the projectile
sample-004960,among these people were a couple of cyclists a gardener i employed sometimes and a girl carrying a baby
sample-004961,you can't be the wind the wind said
sample-004962,it's late in the evening a perfect time for coffee
sample-004963,he reached over and picked up a shell from the ground
sample-004964,they erased all evidence of their crimes
sample-004965,which one of these men is it
sample-004966,the same hand that had brandished the sword now held a whip
sample-004967,it was just ripe enough to eat
sample-004968,they'll believe him
sample-004969,dense clouds of smoke or dust can be seen through a powerful telescope
sample-004970,the alchemist removed the pan from the fire and set it aside to cool
sample-004971,and you know it
sample-004972,what's its value today
sample-004973,the soul of the world is nourished by people's happiness
sample-004974,he doesn't have anything else
sample-004975,i just want to dream about mecca
sample-004976,it was as if the world had fallen silent because the boy's soul had
sample-004977,if he abandons that pursuit it's because it wasn't truelove
sample-004978,one that will write
sample-004979,you lived your life in a loving way and died with dignity
sample-004980,i don't know what it is
sample-004982,it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
sample-004983,there was no way to measure anything of that length
sample-004984,the cover of the magazine showed a cute puppy
sample-004985,go to this address
sample-004986,you already know about alchemy
sample-004987,and eventually man will nourish your sands where the game will once again flourish
sample-004988,now he was here not with his flock but with a shovel
sample-004989,your eyes show the strength of your soul answered the alchemist
sample-004990,the cistern was malfunctioning
sample-004991,finally after hours of waiting the guard bade the boy enter
sample-004992,it had toppled over the brim and fallen into the pit
sample-004993,when the lead had become liquid the alchemist took from his pouch the strange yellow egg
sample-004994,i'm going away he said
sample-004996,the arrow was pointing to the exit
sample-004997,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
sample-004998,and your camels will bring you wealth and power
sample-004999,i'm going to them
sample-005000,he had never imagined that questions about life would be of such importance to a shepherd
sample-005001,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
sample-005002,the boy thought of fatima
sample-005003,they rode for the entire day
sample-005004,why didn't i call you back
sample-005005,gives you an idea of the season
sample-005006,suddenly the elder at the center smiled almost imperceptibly and the boy felt better
sample-005007,the router overheated and needed to be restarted
sample-005010,the stranger seemed satisfied with the answer
sample-005011,there wasn't much impetus to finish our chores
sample-005012,then one day the boy returned the books to the englishman
sample-005013,i had seen all that it would presently bring me
sample-005014,i've been all over town
sample-005015,what do you know about that
sample-005016,he was planning as he left the bar
sample-005017,rachid said he likes pineapple for breakfast
sample-005028,then he sat in the sunfilled doorway smoking the hookah
sample-005029,the camel driver was not a fighter and he had consulted with seers
sample-005038,a great humanitarian and the best friend the jessie bakers have
sample-005039,absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
sample-005040,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
sample-005041,i was torn between fear and curiosity
sample-005042,he took the fourth part and handed it to the monk
sample-005043,my review of the sun one star
sample-005044,i'm not working for any other paper
sample-005045,can you see what is beyond the golden birches 
sample-005046,why the shots stopped after the tenth no one on earth has tried to explain
sample-005047,they were strange books
sample-005048,sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
sample-005049,i locked eyes with a fish in the tank
sample-005050,at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars
sample-005051,chess is a simulation of war
sample-005052,you have no car
sample-005053,arabs often appeared in the city shopping and chanting their strange prayers several times a day
sample-005054,and we had a bite
sample-005055,many people in berkshire surrey and middlesex must have seen it
sample-005056,the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees
sample-005057,did she ever go exploring
sample-005058,they locked themselves in their laboratories and tried to evolve as gold had
sample-005059,i don't see him
sample-005060,yet it was a little too large for assurance
sample-005061,but you want to know something
sample-005062,that's the main idea
sample-005063,an huge hole had been made by the impact of the projectile
sample-005064,who are you he heard a voice ask him in spanish
sample-005065,the incantation was written in italics
sample-005066,my tax dollars pay for those public school proms
sample-005067,but now the sounds inside had stopped
sample-005068,because you are trying to realize your destiny
sample-005069,lots of shepherds passed through selling their wool
sample-005070,they shouted consolation and promises and went off back to the town again to get help
sample-005071,it's what you have always wanted to accomplish
sample-005072,i have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk which was embedded in the ground
sample-005073,the cursor blinked expectantly
sample-005074,there was very little talking
sample-005075,we returned to the cemetery
sample-005076,but they were engaged
sample-005077,continue in the direction of the pyramids said the alchemist
sample-005078,a large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered
sample-005079,they mounted their horses
sample-005080,they began to ride out over the sands with the moon lighting their way
sample-005081,it seemed so safe and tranquil
sample-005082,before him was an enormous white horse rearing over him with a frightening scream
sample-005083,you've got the money
sample-005084,why don't you shut up
sample-005085,he's already got charge of the bank
sample-005086,when playing children often just reenact what they experienced before
sample-005087,his father said no more
sample-005088,i pointed out mars a bright dot of light
sample-005089,what are they doing the old man asked pointing at the people in the plaza
sample-005090,i shall make us some ice cubes
sample-005091,you will never be able to escape from your heart
sample-005092,he's trying to trick you again
sample-005093,let's go and have some lunch said the crystal merchant
sample-005094,sheep ran through the fields as the border collie chased them with fervor
sample-005095,a large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered
sample-005096,eric took his vitamins and continued his exercise regime
sample-005097,wait for the end of the war
sample-005098,the camel driver was not a fighter and he had consulted with seers
sample-005099,as the englishman left fatima arrived and filled her vessel with water
sample-005100,you should see the other guy specifically how good at fighting he is
sample-005101,at that point in their lives everything is clear and everything is possible
sample-005102,an alchemist said the alchemist
sample-005103,it had told him to dig where his tears fell
sample-005104,i got a continuance for a whole month
sample-005105,not only did he manage to do it he did it professionally
sample-005106,i need four hundred and fifty dollars in counterfeit money
sample-005107,he's followed every game and his mouth's watering
sample-005108,the old man gave a signal and everyone stood
sample-005109,where are you going
sample-005110,henderson went into the railway station to telegraph the news to london
sample-005111,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
sample-005112,hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after
sample-005113,where'd you get it
sample-005114,but instead of being saddened he was happy
sample-005115,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
sample-005116,at that point the omens will tell you that your treasure is buried forever
sample-005117,how do you know she didn't
sample-005118,the woman was silent for some time
sample-005119,and then he perceived it very slowly
sample-005120,he almost began to tell about his treasure but decided not to do so
sample-005121,there is only one way to learn the alchemist answered
sample-005122,but he didn't need to worry about that right now
sample-005123,it means only that the heart does what it can the alchemist said
sample-005124,you already know about alchemy
sample-005125,finally after hours of waiting the guard bade the boy enter
sample-005126,you can't believe it's not butter
sample-005127,i understand that it is your dataset and that it is new
sample-005128,looking at the sun he calculated that he would reach tarifa before midday
sample-005129,his hands began to tremble and the woman sensed it
sample-005130,i hate to think that i will have to leave but i guess thats not really up to me
sample-005131,she accused an exconvict of stalking and sexual assault
sample-005132,what would you do with a gun in your back
sample-005133,the shepherd said nothing
sample-005134,i'll return just as your father came back to your mother he said
sample-005135,you could save that poor devil's life
sample-005136,it was my fear of failure that first kept me from attempting the master work
sample-005137,another dreamer said the ticket seller to his assistant watching the boy walk away
sample-005138,then i don't get paid
sample-005139,maybe no one here knows what an alchemist is
sample-005148,the secretary tugged at a loose fibre
sample-005149,he had no idea how he was going to transform himself into the wind
sample-005158,they rode for the entire day
sample-005159,i wouldn't live in it as a ghost
sample-005160,and you ought to read more about the world answered the englishman
sample-005161,all i say is spit them out
sample-005162,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
sample-005163,but they were not there
sample-005164,most meteorites are more or less rounded
sample-005165,shall we tell her what she looks like
sample-005166,he needs three days answered the alchemist
sample-005167,they're going to believe that one
sample-005170,high voltage
sample-005171,i think i found something
sample-005172,my tax dollars pay for those public school proms
sample-005173,a lot of patience but shepherds know all about patience
sample-005174,where's your coat and hat
sample-005175,isn't it a little crowded
sample-005176,it seemed so safe and tranquil
sample-005177,i saw him get it
sample-005188,the snake fought frantically making hissing sounds that shattered the silence of the desert
sample-005189,the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
sample-005198,but he had to move on
sample-005199,when you are in love things make even more sense he thought
sample-005200,lots of shepherds passed through selling their wool
sample-005201,if good things are coming they will be a pleasant surprise said the seer
sample-005202,so we their hearts speak more and more softly
sample-005203,you don't have to be rich skinny popular or even own a cape to perform a random act of kindness
sample-005204,the greatest authority on meteorites stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles
sample-005205,always heed the omens the old king had said
sample-005206,if i had told you you wouldn't have seen the pyramids
sample-005207,you could have married anybody else in town
sample-005210,he needs three days answered the alchemist
sample-005211,how would you like to work for me
sample-005212,i'll be back the boy said
sample-005213,now his intuition was that he had been right in coming
sample-005214,why do they make things so complicated he asked the englishman one night
sample-005215,they become the soul o f the world
sample-005216,i've crossed these sands many times said one of the camel drivers one night
sample-005217,how do people celebrate good weather over there
sample-005228,maybe these desert birds could explain to him the meaning of love without ownership
sample-005229,what do you want
sample-005238,the shop was busy and the man asked the shepherd to wait until the afternoon
sample-005239,i've been looking for you all morning he said as he led the boy outside
sample-005240,i'd like you to take me there if you can
sample-005241,the streamer of gas came out towards us
sample-005242,it was faintly marked with transverse stripes and slightly flattened from the perfect round
sample-005243,the conversation was interrupted by the warehouse boss
sample-005244,i'm going to miss annie
sample-005245,he had never imagined that questions about life would be of such importance to a shepherd
sample-005246,it's a direct line to both my office and my apartment
sample-005247,i read only what the birds wanted to tell me
sample-005248,he had studied latin spanish and theology
sample-005249,the infidels had an evil look about them
sample-005250,there must be somebody there
sample-005251,how about some of that good spaghetti
sample-005252,the emerald tablet is a direct passage to the soul of the world
sample-005253,he offered the kids some icecream
sample-005254,just teach me to be the wind for a few moments the boy said
sample-005255,how did you learn to read the girl asked at one point
sample-005256,the englishman was unable to sleep one night
sample-005257,there were raised voicesand some sort of struggle appeared to be going on 
sample-005258,but would you mind telling me who goes out
sample-005259,but he knew that salem wasn't in andalusia
sample-005260,every search begins with beginner's luck
sample-005261,who told you to do that
sample-005262,my review of the sun one star
sample-005263,it spread through the planet's atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features
sample-005264,haven't you got a bullet i can bite
sample-005265,after the long night i am happy to see that my phone still has a charge
sample-005266,it was a pleasant change from talking to his sheep
sample-005267,it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience
sample-005268,among these people were a couple of cyclists a gardener i employed sometimes and a girl carrying a baby
sample-005269,that he wanted to travel
sample-005270,give me my book the boy said
sample-005271,yes its disorganized but it will still happen
sample-005272,we better hold onto them both
sample-005273,i have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk which was embedded in the ground
sample-005274,maktub the boy said remembering the crystal merchant
sample-005275,i just want to dream about mecca
sample-005276,it's not what enters men's mouths that's evil said the alchemist
sample-005277,who is your friend the chief asked
sample-005278,i'll have the paper send the money right down to you
sample-005279,after all who doesnt want to overcome new challenges and achieve great heights
sample-005280,this banana tastes like cherries
sample-005281,can you do your stuff
sample-005282,but then they wouldn't be a part of your future the seer had said
sample-005283,you should never cross the street when the traffic light shows red
sample-005284,stop calling me that
sample-005285,as was mecca for the merchant
sample-005286,that night he told all of this to the alchemist
sample-005287,he could sell the stones and buy a return ticket
sample-005288,we don't know when the war will end so we can't continue our journey he said
sample-005289,i was scared but wasted no time in going out and crossing the bridge to the sand pits
sample-005290,i don't want to change anything because i don't know how to deal with change
sample-005291,and the solid part was called the philosopher's stone
sample-005292,how do you mean
sample-005293,he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
sample-005294,i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
sample-005295,it's extremely suspicious that there's no information about brains that didn't come from a brain
sample-005296,but can we trust him
sample-005297,i've been all over town
sample-005298,the tradition teaches men how to cross the desert and how their children should marry
sample-005299,we cannot forget that farce
sample-005300,from here on you will be alone the alchemist said
sample-005301,they were given to me as a present by a king the boy said
sample-005302,then suddenly he noticed it with a start
sample-005303,it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
sample-005304,the thirteenth of march is meant to be unlucky
sample-005305,my advice is duck and cross with your right
sample-005306,but they don't count
sample-005307,and then the boy understood
sample-005308,he was squatting in a corner doing yoga
sample-005310,when she tried to withdraw some money from her bank account the atm claimed her card was invalid
sample-005311,the children were almost tyrannical
sample-005312,the men at the bar were obviously drunk
sample-005313,you should see the other guy specifically how good at fighting he is
sample-005314,he appeared with the first stars of evening
sample-005315,what is it that i still need to know the boy asked
sample-005316,i can't do that
sample-005317,you're in luck you two the fat arab said
sample-005318,and she already has her treasure it's you
sample-005319,can i get a woot woot
sample-005320,i recovered myself and continued the walk home
sample-005322,the alchemist is two hundred years old the englishman had told him
sample-005323,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
sample-005324,then he dropped his spade picked up his jacket and came out into the road
sample-005325,times are different now
sample-005326,the letter said that the payment was delayed
sample-005327,it belongs to me now
sample-005328,how old are you anyway
sample-005329,so we their hearts speak more and more softly
sample-005330,she cried for an hour
sample-005331,i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit
sample-005332,but i'd like to see the castles in the towns where they live the boy explained
sample-005333,they seemed to laugh at him and he laughed back his heart bursting with joy
sample-005334,the old man wore a breastplate of gold and he knew about my past
sample-005336,regarding your request i have decided to heed your warnings
sample-005337,it was starlight and i explained the signs of the zodiac to her
sample-005338,strange images passed through my mind
sample-005339,i guess you forgot something
sample-005348,who told you that asked the boy startled
sample-005349,it's called the principle of favorability
sample-005358,in some places the ground was covered with the salt of driedup lakes
sample-005359,not what you'd call rich
sample-005360,and one or two persons were returning
sample-005361,as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
sample-005362,the whole army of them
sample-005363,i want you to be my wife
sample-005364,hunches his mother used to call them
sample-005365,that was until the site was blocked
sample-005366,but i found it difficult to get to work because of the investigations
sample-005367,but he appeared to be unaware of any danger
sample-005370,but he granted the travelers three days
sample-005371,this is as far as the elevator goes
sample-005372,he hoped that it would be someone as capable as his previous apprentice
sample-005373,he must be disguised to avoid encounters with thieves
sample-005374,the strange horseman drew an enormous curved sword from a scabbard mounted on his saddle
sample-005375,i'm interested only in the present
sample-005376,or a man into the wind
sample-005377,it was a tent like many at the oasis
sample-005388,he remembered something his grandfather had once told him that butterflies were a good omen
sample-005389,you brought a new feeling into my crystal shop
sample-005398,he transformed himself into a stone that rolled up to the miner's foot
sample-005399,they mounted their horses
sample-005400,you got to help us
sample-005401,please never throw salami pizza away
sample-005402,and i'm certain you'll find it the alchemist said
sample-005403,i'm going into the desert the man answered turning back to his reading
sample-005404,yet it was a little too large for assurance
sample-005405,there was very little talking
sample-005406,i had seen all that it would presently bring me
sample-005407,i'm going to find that damned alchemist the englishman thought
sample-005410,we speak of them only to children
sample-005411,shall i pray for him
sample-005412,they could barely see the boy
sample-005413,what's wrong with that
sample-005414,i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
sample-005415,the angel touched the man's shoulder and they were both projected far into the future
sample-005416,that sobered him a little
sample-005417,the view had better be worth it
sample-005428,they were looking only for gold his companion answered
sample-005429,the englishman vanished too gone to find the alchemist
sample-005438,he remembered something his grandfather had once told him that butterflies were a good omen
sample-005439,i started to run like crazy and made for the first group of trees
sample-005440,he noticed the unequal cooling of its surface
sample-005441,that this house may never know hunger
sample-005442,that gives you an idea of what i'm up against
sample-005443,and one or two persons were returning
sample-005444,how do you think the table looks
sample-005445,it was the time of day when all of spain slept during the summer
sample-005446,it was faintly marked with transverse stripes and slightly flattened from the perfect round
sample-005448,i'm getting out of here and you can't stop me
sample-005449,but i didnt think that it contained any living creature
sample-005450,i just don't trust anyone who says they've never had hamburger helper
sample-005451,based on the omens of the present
sample-005452,they're closing in on you
sample-005454,i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit
sample-005455,that was until the site was blocked
sample-005456,he knew how to shear them and how to slaughter them
sample-005457,the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees
sample-005458,monday morning at five o'clock
sample-005459,hang on for a second
sample-005460,before the boy could reply a butterfly appeared and fluttered between him and the old man
sample-005461,i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
sample-005462,now i will drift gently off to dreamland
sample-005463,i didn't fall in
sample-005464,this artful creation is more than just a picture it's a statement by the artist
sample-005465,because life wants you to achieve your destiny
sample-005466,it was just that he couldn't grasp what it meant
sample-005467,do you know what cia stands for
sample-005468,nobody wanted to discuss how we all ended up trapped in a giant lunchbox
sample-005469,my mind ran on the possibilities of its content
sample-005470,what about higgins against becca
sample-005471,and so do i
sample-005472,the desert takes our men from us and they don't always return she said
sample-005473,he's already killed three men
sample-005474,pedro hugged his teddy as hard as he could
sample-005475,the morning post is not obstructing justice or hiding criminals
sample-005476,i almost dropped him
sample-005477,don't let them see that you're afraid the alchemist said
sample-005478,i don't want any plastics
sample-005479,this specific approach won't bear any fruit
sample-005480,it could prove fatal for them as well as yourself
sample-005481,you gave them everything i had the boy said
sample-005482,he had suddenly remembered that in tarifa there was an old woman who interpreted dreams
sample-005483,his father said no more
sample-005485,it's raining heavily take an umbrella
sample-005486,you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
sample-005487,i don't want anything else in life
sample-005488,because now he knew where his treasure was
sample-005489,have you got it
sample-005491,the ivy climbed up the building and wrapped itself around the chimney
sample-005492,i'll bet it's a summons
sample-005493,i thought about whether we should find coins and models in it and so on
sample-005494,maybe he should not call people names that they don't want to be called
sample-005495,or a man into the wind
sample-005496,but it is not a class that was requested by our alumni or prospective students
sample-005497,don't take any chances
sample-005498,the top had certainly ceased to rotate
sample-005499,if you start your emails with greetings let me be the first to welcome you to earth
sample-005500,he dressed in his arabian clothing of white linen bought especially for this day
sample-005501,the englishman was disappointed
sample-005502,only it'll be a lot easier with you
sample-005503,the boy told him then that he needed to get to the pyramids
sample-005504,the elevators are still running
sample-005505,the place is so full of cockroaches
sample-005506,thank you said the boy
sample-005507,but he certainly didn't desire that an army invade the oasis
sample-005508,somebody should eat the mango i guess it is me
sample-005509,the tin was made from aluminium
sample-005510,i think jamie did it
sample-005511,he saw the boy appear from the other side of the dunes
sample-005512,he could always go back to being a shepherd
sample-005513,it was the levanter the wind that came from africa
sample-005514,the land was ruined and i had to find some other way to earn a living
sample-005515,some went away while i was there and other people came
sample-005516,a line of flame high can be seen in the atmosphere
sample-005517,isn't the party also to announce his engagement to joanna
sample-005518,speak to the hand that wrote all said the sun
sample-005519,get martin out of jail
sample-005520,most of them were staring quietly at the big table
sample-005521,something bright reflected from his chest with such intensity that the boy was momentarily blinded
sample-005522,my wife gave me this on my last birthday
sample-005523,i just know that the tradition is always right
sample-005524,what's my name doing on it
sample-005525,and the odor of the animals became a bit more tolerable
sample-005526,drinking too much water in a short period of time can be lethal
sample-005527,i've crossed these sands many times said one of the camel drivers one night
sample-005528,that's good thought the englishman
sample-005529,the boy went to the well every day to meet with fatima
sample-005530,they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
sample-005531,the crowd swayed a little as i elbowed my way through
sample-005532,so he could not be hasty nor impatient
sample-005533,a missing parrot is called a polygon
sample-005534,my review of the sun one star
sample-005535,i need four hundred and fifty dollars in counterfeit money
sample-005536,i'm going to wait here for you every day
sample-005537,don't make a government project out of this
sample-005538,what a load of trash sarah opined
sample-005539,did you say a king he asked
sample-005548,that can't be true
sample-005549,he wanted your money he said
sample-005558,just one thing more
sample-005559,who could have predicted that
sample-005560,he got up early with the idea of finding it
sample-005561,you can't desert now
sample-005562,and i'm certain you'll find it the alchemist said
sample-005563,well i'd like to see their land and see how they live said his son
sample-005564,they eat lunch together often but dont really talk outside the office
sample-005565,get me walter burns
sample-005566,they don't see that the fields are new and the seasons change
sample-005567,a practice of infidels he said to himself
sample-005570,many telescopes were pointed at it
sample-005571,after performing calibration the precision is noticeably better
sample-005572,anything i can do back here
sample-005573,how long will it take to get him examined
sample-005574,i couldn't ascertain the reason
sample-005575,it knew of the boy's talk with the desert because the winds know everything
sample-005576,they become the soul o f the world
sample-005577,might start to rain again
sample-005588,we can't leave greg here
sample-005589,it receded into the hole

sample-005599,and you can meet us at the station
sample-005600,know what my old man did when i joined up
sample-005601,this man's going to jump as a matter of principle
sample-005602,i'm going into the desert the man answered turning back to his reading
sample-005603,a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder
sample-005604,it was faintly marked with transverse stripes and slightly flattened from the perfect round
sample-005605,i'm never more aware of a room's acoustics than when i'm trying to enjoy a snack i have no intention of sharing
sample-005606,he disappeared into the tent
sample-005607,i still can't understand it though
sample-005610,the jacket had a purpose and so did the boy
sample-005611,he was shaken into wakefulness by someone
sample-005612,he had helped him out in a dangerous situation
sample-005613,i finally purchased a private jet
sample-005614,i'm afraid that if my dream is realized i'll have no reason to go on living
sample-005615,it's a code said the boy a bit disappointed
sample-005616,that's about the best description i know
sample-005617,dense clouds of smoke or dust can be seen through a powerful telescope
sample-005628,but would you mind telling me who goes out
sample-005629,emoticons are familiar to everyone nowadays
sample-005638,the problem is that they don't even realize that they're walking a new road every day
sample-005639,the boy was trying to understand the truth of what the old man had said
sample-005640,when were these books written the boy asked
sample-005641,why did we have to have all these kids
sample-005642,the lead had dried into the shape of the pan but it was no longer lead
sample-005643,they walked together through the narrow streets of tangier
sample-005644,i was torn between fear and curiosity
sample-005645,i'll talk to you tonight
sample-005646,that's why i'm here in the middle of het desert
sample-005647,dense clouds of smoke or dust can be seen through a powerful telescope
sample-005648,there's no law against stealing stolen money
sample-005649,but i'm so awkward at parties
sample-005650,but he certainly didn't desire that an army invade the oasis
sample-005651,camels are traitorous they walk thousands of paces and never seem to tire
sample-005652,why didn't you deliver them right away
sample-005653,did you write that letter to miss mitchell
sample-005654,the congestion was heavy throughout the city
sample-005655,at once he connected the two incidents
sample-005656,i don't know how to turn them into reality
sample-005657,i'm going to wait here for you every day
sample-005658,i suppose that's true in a way
sample-005659,they wouldn't take it
sample-005660,are you going to let her out
sample-005661,i'm trying to explain to my mother how to get pictures off her phone
sample-005662,it was bunched up and he had hardly thought of it for a long time
sample-005663,it was a cobra whose venom could kill a person in minutes
sample-005664,and they found the watch on him
sample-005665,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
sample-005666,as he sat there thinking he sensed movement above him
sample-005667,it was bunched up and he had hardly thought of it for a long time
sample-005668,and you've told me nothing along the way said the boy
sample-005669,i still have no idea how to turn myself into the wind the boy repeated
sample-005670,but you know that i'm not going to go to mecca
sample-005671,the boy knew and was now working toward it
sample-005672,i like icecream
sample-005673,water boarding is a terrible form of torture
sample-005674,but before i go i want to tell you a little story
sample-005675,they formed heaps that are visible a mile and a half away
sample-005676,peter shrunk back aghast
sample-005677,it must have fallen while i was sitting over there
sample-005678,i'm afraid i already know a great many people
sample-005679,i don't know how to turn them into reality
sample-005680,his life and his path had always provided him with enough omens
sample-005681,what's the fifth obligation the boy asked
sample-005682,hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after
sample-005683,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
sample-005684,bakers have homes while shepherds sleep out in the open
sample-005685,i've crossed these sands many times said one of the camel drivers one night
sample-005686,the boy swore that every time he heard the alarm he would heed its message
sample-005687,a practice of infidels he said to himself
sample-005688,what would you say to giving them a joint interview
sample-005689,how do you feel
sample-005690,what idiot wrote this total drivel
sample-005691,i don't know if i'll be able to find life in the desert the boy thought

sample-005701,they're not my sheep anymore he said to himself without nostalgia
sample-005702,certainly i'm sure i'm comfortable
sample-005703,it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-005704,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment

sample-005826,i forgot to thank you for those roses
sample-005827,not everyone can see his dreams come true in the same way

sample-005852,he approached the mass and was surprised at the size and the shape
sample-005853,the boy had met the alchemist
sample-005854,where does she get that stuff
sample-005855,not to worry said the alchemist
sample-005856,the conspiracy nuts will love this

sample-005859,the old man looked disappointed

sample-005861,you are the best
sample-005862,you can't say that about my father
sample-005863,of course the two were unable to do anything

sample-005868,i'll be back the boy said
sample-005869,about how wealthy would you say

sample-005871,only in that way would he be able to read the omens
sample-005872,they spoke about mercury salt dragons and kings and he didn't understand any of it
sample-005873,who told you about omens the boy's interest was increasing by the moment

sample-005881,he ran his fingers slowly over the stones sensing their temperature and feeling their surfaces
sample-005882,i told him that was what i had come here to learn
sample-005883,but the boy sat down and waited
sample-005884,i hope some of the lines make you smile
sample-005885,but that's the jail
sample-005886,you don't have to do anything of the kind
sample-005887,down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace

sample-005987,you don't call this a convenience
sample-005990,you'd think i was on the witness stand

sample-005993,the handle snagged my coat
sample-005994,been seeing me in your dreams
sample-005995,meanwhile the old man persisted in his attempt to strike up a conversation
sample-005996,he noticed the unequal cooling of its surface

sample-006000,all that time the martians must have been getting ready

sample-006005,there is no wine in this country the young man said

sample-006007,but his heart was speaking of other things
sample-006008,a monk dressed in black came to the gates
sample-006009,does the name brian anderson mean anything to you

sample-006013,he paused and his eyes were still unfriendly
sample-006014,you've got everything all set
sample-006015,i won't leave you
sample-006016,his soul must be too primitive to understand those things he thought
sample-006017,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
sample-006018,i heard what you were talking about the other day with the alchemist the wind said
sample-006019,not always in this way but i always appear in one form or another
sample-006020,that he wanted to travel
sample-006021,when my only child was  she said something that really pissed me off
sample-006022,i done my best
sample-006023,the camel drivers exchanged information about windstorms and told stories about the desert
sample-006024,that'll close my account
sample-006025,the boy remembered his dream and suddenly everything was clear to him

sample-006027,you know i'd tell you if i had it
sample-006028,listen to the woman
sample-006029,help my son megan tonight
sample-006030,meanwhile the old man persisted in his attempt to strike up a conversation
sample-006031,it's candice now on long distance from washington
sample-006032,but he knew that salem wasn't in andalusia
sample-006033,like when you go into a drugstore
sample-006034,i have clearly been discriminated because of my sex the feminist complained
sample-006035,but the marketplace was empty and he was far from home so he wept
sample-006036,the alchemist stopped abruptly and bent to the ground
sample-006037,it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
sample-006038,i pointed out mars a bright dot of light
sample-006039,i'm not interested in your book
sample-006040,finally after hours of waiting the guard bade the boy enter
sample-006041,and one or two persons were returning
sample-006042,yes or even search for treasure
sample-006043,why don't you try johns hopkins in baltimore

sample-006052,the police probably think i killed him
sample-006053,but they were not there
sample-006054,you came so that you could learn about your dreams said the old woman
sample-006055,the merchant was silent for a few moments
sample-006056,i don't much like change he said
sample-006057,coming home a party of tourists passed us singing and playing music
sample-006068,then came the night of the first falling star
sample-006069,we're just slowly plodding through some user interviews at the moment
sample-006078,sexuality is a mystery
sample-006079,as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
sample-006080,forget it there is no such thing
sample-006081,henderson went into the railway station to telegraph the news to london
sample-006082,the sword remained where it was
sample-006083,the percentage of carbon dioxide in the air reached an extraordinary level
sample-006084,the other bridge was for everyone else

sample-006086,but she hadn't charged him anything
sample-006087,there was enough there to buy a lot of weapons
sample-006090,they were given to me as a present by a king the boy said
sample-006091,everyone has his or her own way of learning things he said to himself
sample-006092,and look how many things the wind already knew how to do
sample-006093,it was glaringly hot not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind
sample-006094,the level ground was blackened as far as one could see and it was still giving off smoke
sample-006095,somewhere you are holding the person i love the boy said
sample-006096,i'll kill both of them

sample-006108,the determinant is the product of all eigenvectors of a matrix
sample-006109,everything vintage you can imagine that can fit into a small space is there
sample-006118,it was glaringly hot not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind
sample-006119,the alchemist dismounted and told the escorts they could return to the camp
sample-006120,i finally purchased a private jet
sample-006121,some storms are worth the wreckage
sample-006122,your luck's not with you now
sample-006123,i don't know how to find life in the desert the boy said
sample-006124,then he sat in the sunfilled doorway smoking the hookah
sample-006125,they crossed the desert for another two days in silence
sample-006126,i've been looking all over town trying to find you
sample-006127,i feel i ought to take care of her
sample-006130,the thought was so dreadful to him that he forgot about the heat and went forward
sample-006131,he's talking like a child
sample-006132,i need some coffee
sample-006133,before this i always looked to the desert with longing said fatima
sample-006134,why the shots stopped after the tenth no one on earth has tried to explain
sample-006135,it's a man who understands nature and the world
sample-006136,he was twenty minutes from his tent and began to make his way there
sample-006137,i don't know where to go
sample-006140,had our instruments permitted it we might have been able to see the trouble way back when
sample-006141,he arose and taking up his crook began to awaken the sheep that still slept
sample-006142,they were hiding him
sample-006143,had our instruments permitted it we might have been able to see the trouble way back when
sample-006144,several figures approached him
sample-006145,eye trackers used to cost several thousand dollars but now you can grab a cheap one for less than a couple hundred bucks
sample-006146,yet each felt his heart beat a bit faster
sample-006147,a large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered
sample-006148,everything in life is an omen said the englishman now closing the journal he was reading
sample-006149,where do you live shouted the boy as the horseman rode away
sample-006150,it was dropping off in flakes and raining down on the sand
sample-006151,their faces were covered with the blue cloths and their eyes showed fear
sample-006152,you need to see this
sample-006153,he could see that the old man wanted to know more about his life
sample-006154,your luck's not with you now
sample-006155,that's the man who knows all the secrets of the world she said
sample-006156,it didn't bring with it the smell of the desert nor the threat of moorish invasion
sample-006157,even from a distance their eyes conveyed the strength of their souls
sample-006158,when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood

sample-006169,i don't much like change he said
sample-006170,i just want to dream about mecca

sample-006176,i'm a woman of the desert she said averting her face
sample-006177,i'm going to hate those who have found their treasure because i never found mine
sample-006178,when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
sample-006179,the merchant looked anxiously at the boy
sample-006180,it must have fallen while i was sitting over there
sample-006181,they mounted their horses
sample-006182,can i help you
sample-006183,it's practically up there now
sample-006184,he took his money from his pouch and showed it to the young man
sample-006185,he decided to concentrate on more practical matters
sample-006186,i guess you're right
sample-006187,and one or two persons were returning
sample-006188,what's wrong with that
sample-006189,it was the devil
sample-006190,he stuck his hand into the pouch and felt around for one of the stones
sample-006191,he left without saying goodbye to the crystal merchant
sample-006192,the police have kindly provided us with a list
sample-006193,he also tried to remember some good stories to relate as he sheared the sheep
sample-006194,i'm so glad to see you
sample-006195,are you crazy the boy asked the alchemist when they had moved on
sample-006196,the newspaper articles had prepared everyone for the reception of the idea
sample-006197,once to the thief and once to the general
sample-006198,why do you think i brought you here
sample-006200,ten years at the university and here i am in a corral
sample-006201,it was glaringly hot not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind
sample-006202,you've got swell form
sample-006203,of course the two were unable to do anything
sample-006204,strange images passed through my mind
sample-006205,the motorway is not the fastest connection between hamburg and munich
sample-006206,that's the philosopher's stone and the elixir of life
sample-006207,this guy stole my watch
sample-006208,at other times at a crucial moment i make it easier for things to happen
sample-006209,the experimental methodology lacks separate validation set
sample-006210,we heard a lot of yelling
sample-006211,give me the district attorney's office
sample-006212,you brought a new feeling into my crystal shop
sample-006213,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
sample-006214,two days later the merchant spoke to the boy about the display
sample-006215,whenever he could he sought out a new road to travel
sample-006216,even then he hardly understood what this meant
sample-006217,some storms are worth the wreckage
sample-006218,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
sample-006219,it was a tent like many at the oasis
sample-006220,symbols of the little people
sample-006221,it helped me to trust in people the englishman answered
sample-006222,i don't know if i'll be able to find life in the desert the boy thought
sample-006223,my seven year resume gap is marked not drugs
sample-006224,they tell their incredible stories at the time when you want to hear them
sample-006225,he was immensely excited at the news
sample-006226,i wanted to sleep a little longer he thought
sample-006227,other servants maintained the fires in the hookahs
sample-006228,the gods should not have desires because they don't have destinies
sample-006229,have trusted more in your love for fatima
sample-006230,did you want to see me
sample-006231,what about higgins against becca
sample-006232,the night was warm and i was thirsty
sample-006233,i was impatient to see it opened
sample-006234,absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
sample-006235,the alchemist opened a bottle and poured a red liquid into the boy's cup
sample-006236,it's easy and yet i've never done it before he thought
sample-006237,maybe the alchemist has never been in love the boy thought
sample-006238,the global positioning system works with triangulation
sample-006239,the deranged developer revised his application source code after a careful study of its contents
sample-006240,if what one finds is made of pure matter it will never spoil
sample-006241,at the first glance it was really not very exciting
sample-006242,in some places the ground was covered with the salt of driedup lakes
sample-006243,but i'm beginning to understand a lot of things
sample-006244,there must be somebody there
sample-006245,and you ought to read more about the world answered the englishman
sample-006246,i told you i can't use your column any more
sample-006247,then he turned to the boy this time his expression was cold and distant
sample-006250,you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
sample-006251,and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
sample-006252,the boy could certainly resist causing that kind of anxiety for the baker
sample-006253,the hunter was alerted by the sound of rustling vegetation behind her
sample-006254,a line of flame high can be seen in the atmosphere
sample-006255,turn on the lights
sample-006256,it was a tent like many at the oasis
sample-006257,what's the world's greatest lie the boy asked completely surprised
sample-006268,it belongs to me now
sample-006269,there were three hundred wells fifty thousand date trees and innumerable colored tents spread among them
sample-006278,the boy was surprised and then irritated
sample-006279,you can't believe it's not butter
sample-006280,i don't know why these things have to be transmitted by word of mouth he thought
sample-006281,jane spoke emphatically
sample-006282,this wasn't a strange place it was a new one
sample-006283,and eventually man will nourish your sands where the game will once again flourish
sample-006284,wish i had a million dollars
sample-006285,but you are forcing me to look at wealth and at horizons i have never known
sample-006286,it doesn't matter he said to his sheep
sample-006287,you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
sample-006290,i wonder what's eating that old money grubbing buzzard anyway
sample-006291,promise you'll never lie the way snoopy did
sample-006292,your wife was wanted by the university of florida
sample-006293,that's the reason why i came in fourth
sample-006294,he didn't know the man yet but his practiced eye would recognize him when he appeared
sample-006295,the smoker cleared his lungs of phlegm
sample-006296,the shop was busy and the man asked the shepherd to wait until the afternoon
sample-006297,symbols of the little people
sample-006308,no one said a word as the old man continued
sample-006309,he wanted to forget about the vision and return to his meditation
sample-006318,i'm beginning to realize that
sample-006319,we were all made by the same hand and we have the same soul
sample-006320,he moved about invisible but everyone could hear him
sample-006321,i've actually fallen in love with him
sample-006322,he's trying to trick you again
sample-006323,hope you enjoy it
sample-006324,that makes sense the alchemist answered
sample-006325,mr and mrs nate joined the red cross and sewed
sample-006326,because life wants you to achieve your destiny
sample-006327,does this belong to you
sample-006330,what's the difference between hibernation and standby mode
sample-006331,i'm never more aware of a room's acoustics than when i'm trying to enjoy a snack i have no intention of sharing
sample-006332,i'll work for you he said
sample-006333,all the type  has been sent to salt lake
sample-006334,they can't help themselves
sample-006335,some men were smoking from a gigantic pipe that they passed from one to the other
sample-006336,but children always seem to be able to play with them without frightening them
sample-006337,you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
sample-006340,i don't want to change anything because i don't know how to deal with change
sample-006341,the boy swore that every time he heard the alarm he would heed its message
sample-006342,he hoped that it would be someone as capable as his previous apprentice
sample-006343,but the alchemist continued to look to the horizon
sample-006344,he was selling better than ever
sample-006345,it's a dream in the language of the world she said
sample-006346,i'm going to miss annie
sample-006347,then leave with the caravan
sample-006348,speak to the hand that wrote all said the sun
sample-006349,let's stop this another commander said
sample-006350,i would have won the junior olympics if not for those medaling kids
sample-006351,he sat looking at the sky for a long time
sample-006352,the nearby city of ceuta had grown faster than tangier and business had fallen off
sample-006353,a current of love rushed from his heart and the boy began to pray
sample-006354,they have gotten used to my being away and so have i
sample-006355,after the long night i am happy to see that my phone still has a charge
sample-006356,i myself heard nothing of that
sample-006357,it knew of the boy's talk with the desert because the winds know everything
sample-006358,and he knew what was the fair price for every one of his animals
sample-006359,she carefully removed the evidence from its packaging
sample-006360,go back to watching the caravan he said
sample-006361,i bet you she'd know how to say it all right
sample-006362,everyone when they are young knows what their destiny is
sample-006363,i know that girl
sample-006364,i'm going into the desert the man answered turning back to his reading
sample-006365,the men climbed the hill and they were tired when they reached the top
sample-006366,then suddenly he noticed it with a start
sample-006367,the report was largely scathing
sample-006368,the boy knew and was now working toward it
sample-006369,he wasn't asking for help
sample-006370,am i talking too much
sample-006371,but the boy was certain that he had been looking at them
sample-006372,the boy trusted his new friend
sample-006373,lighthouses in a foggy world
sample-006374,it's the oasis said the camel driver
sample-006375,i can't think of any enemies i have
sample-006376,i didn't know shepherds knew how to read said a girl's voice behind him
sample-006377,the fourth component of homogeneous coordinates is usually set to 
sample-006378,he disappeared into the tent
sample-006379,because you'll know its dreams and wishes and will know how to deal with them
sample-006380,i was sent down here to clean house
sample-006381,firefox is probably the easiest to get started with although i prefer chrome
sample-006382,he had assumed he would soon return to his sheep
sample-006383,he was my brother
sample-006384,one of these days is tomorrow
sample-006385,i promise i will be careful
sample-006386,i just know that the tradition is always right
sample-006387,he told them all to be seated
sample-006388,he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
sample-006389,the streamer of gas came out towards us
sample-006390,it would kill you
sample-006391,air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
sample-006392,you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
sample-006393,never mind the european war
sample-006394,all they ever do really is look for food and water
sample-006395,the merchant looked anxiously at the boy
sample-006396,i don't want to change anything because i don't know how to deal with change
sample-006397,the airplane rose gracefully into the sky
sample-006398,say hello to new york for me
sample-006399,the old man wore a breastplate of heavy gold covered with precious stones
sample-006400,the omens will begin insistently to speak of it and you'll try to ignore them
sample-006401,a while ago i rode through the desert with a man who had books on alchemy
sample-006402,four hundred and fifty dollars
sample-006403,as soon as he saw me among the crowd he called to me to come down
sample-006404,where is the treasure he asked
sample-006405,what is a foreigner doing here asked another of the men
sample-006406,heehaw and merry christmas
sample-006407,from the railway station in the distance came the sound of trains ringing and rumbling
sample-006408,that's good thought the englishman
sample-006409,this banana tastes like cherries
sample-006410,to show you one of life's simple lessons the alchemist answered
sample-006411,i've had a dozen calls already
sample-006412,but now the sounds inside had stopped
sample-006413,it doesn't matter he said to his sheep
sample-006414,so what do you want of me the sun asked
sample-006415,it's too bad that he's quickly going to forget my name he thought
sample-006416,i own my own house
sample-006417,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
sample-006418,finally a young woman approached who was not dressed in black
sample-006419,walking along in the silence he had no regrets
sample-006420,better to get half than nothing
sample-006421,what time is it
sample-006422,they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
sample-006423,can i get a woot woot
sample-006424,nope not going unless they have a giant inflatable slide
sample-006425,the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
sample-006426,sometimes it's better to be with the sheep who don't say anything
sample-006427,they're desperate and will do anything for a cup of coffee
sample-006428,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
sample-006429,that's why i'm here in the middle of het desert
sample-006430,some went away while i was there and other people came
sample-006431,carol saved her brother's life that day
sample-006432,he reached over and picked up a shell from the ground
sample-006433,it was faintly marked with transverse stripes and slightly flattened from the perfect round
sample-006434,the boy felt a pang in his heart thinking about the merchant's daughter
sample-006435,do you want to wake that baby
sample-006436,until one of them dies i couldn't possibly meet anyone else
sample-006437,the opening dilated and squeezed the amorphous entity out onto the floor
sample-006438,i'm crazy about adrian
sample-006439,at the first glance it was really not very exciting
sample-006440,but fatima's hands held to the handles of her jug
sample-006441,the level ground was blackened as far as one could see and it was still giving off smoke
sample-006442,air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
sample-006443,he believed in omens
sample-006444,the boy knew the desert sensed his fear
sample-006445,i don't care whose picture they're publishing
sample-006446,i didn't know shepherds knew how to read said a girl's voice behind him
sample-006447,i'm going to them
sample-006450,you mean you're not coming back to work here
sample-006451,but then i realized she couldn't have been
sample-006452,don't forget that everything you deal with is only one thing and nothing else
sample-006453,but it is not a class that was requested by our alumni or prospective students
sample-006454,i left when the zoning changed and the real estate market has boomed
sample-006455,the sun thought about that and decided to shine more brightly
sample-006456,the desert takes our men from us and they don't always return she said
sample-006457,albert didn't have a brother
sample-006468,when i'm eating that's all i think about
sample-006469,where is the treasure he asked
sample-006478,i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
sample-006479,suddenly the elder at the center smiled almost imperceptibly and the boy felt better
sample-006480,she asked herself how many times do i need to listen to him sing
sample-006481,want to know what it is
sample-006482,know what my old man did when i joined up
sample-006483,upon returning to the wise man he related in detail everything he had seen
sample-006484,he was about the same age and height as the boy
sample-006485,why you lied to me
sample-006486,we've done it said the englishman who had also awakened early
sample-006487,hires two personal trainers and make one of them train the other one
sample-006490,walking along in the silence he had no regrets
sample-006491,among these people were a couple of cyclists a gardener i employed sometimes and a girl carrying a baby
sample-006492,the two men exchanged some words in arabic and the bar owner seemed irritated
sample-006493,i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
sample-006494,my review of the sun one star
sample-006495,that was the law of hospitality
sample-006496,the boy approached her to ask about the alchemist
sample-006497,the serpent relaxed immediately
sample-006508,then he dropped his spade picked up his jacket and came out into the road
sample-006509,the hookahs were extinguished and the guards stood at attention
sample-006518,two days ago you said that i had never dreamed of travel the merchant answered
sample-006519,cassie dismantled the bicycle
sample-006520,the sheep had taught him that
sample-006521,we don't know what's in the confounded thing do you
sample-006522,i can interpret it but the interpretation is very difficult
sample-006523,they raise their glasses
sample-006524,i was wondering if you could tell me a bit more about what it's like to live and work there
sample-006525,four hundred and fifty dollars
sample-006526,then what's a big political boss like shiela daniels doing in town
sample-006527,he was shaken into wakefulness by someone
sample-006530,the guy thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to stop him
sample-006531,the strange horseman drew an enormous curved sword from a scabbard mounted on his saddle
sample-006532,it was only when i got this close to it that the strangeness of it was at all evident to me
sample-006533,most of them were staring quietly at the big table
sample-006534,it was such a thrill her veins were pumped full of adrenaline
sample-006535,the arab accepted them without a word
sample-006536,the englishman could not contain his excitement
sample-006537,want to walk to new york
sample-006540,at the camp it was difficult to see anything
sample-006541,we could get to the pyramids by tomorrow said the other taking the money
sample-006542,that's exactly what i thought
sample-006543,the whole creature heaved and pulsated convulsively
sample-006544,i won't leave you
sample-006545,maktub thought the boy
sample-006546,and at that i told him and he took my place
sample-006547,thanks for dropping around
sample-006548,but that was simply because my eye was tired
sample-006549,you wanna take this outside
sample-006550,why don't you have your friends join us
sample-006551,all set for the big night
sample-006552,he was a wealthy man
sample-006553,will you give me your blessing asked the boy
sample-006554,the plastic barrier shattered
sample-006555,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
sample-006556,there's one that says 'everything that happens once can never happen again
sample-006557,the greatest authority on meteorites stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles
sample-006558,having heard that the boy became even more interested in alchemy
sample-006559,at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars
sample-006560,the boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid responding to her question
sample-006561,but you are in the desert
sample-006562,the giraffe had become fearful
sample-006563,he suggested that the boy look around the palace and return in two hours
sample-006564,down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
sample-006565,and i'm certain you'll find it the alchemist said
sample-006566,why the shots stopped after the tenth no one on earth has tried to explain
sample-006567,the night was warm and i was thirsty
sample-006568,i thought tonight i'd put miss kelly there
sample-006569,his father said no more
sample-006570,merry christmas my dears
sample-006571,chickens lay so many eggs a week it wouldn't be possible to breed them all
sample-006572,just hurry up and get here
sample-006573,i don't much like change he said
sample-006574,don't forget that everything you deal with is only one thing and nothing else
sample-006575,i have the money i need to buy my sheep
sample-006576,about eleven i walked back to my home in maybury because nothing seemed to be happening
sample-006577,the crowd gasped as they realised that the speaker was completely naked
sample-006578,their faces were hidden behind blue veils with only their eyes showing
sample-006579,we have that all figured out
sample-006580,and i'd better read your books said the boy
sample-006581,and he asked the boy if he too were in search of the alchemist
sample-006582,i read only what the birds wanted to tell me
sample-006583,a card hanging in the doorway announced that several languages were spoken in the shop
sample-006584,i thought about whether we should find coins and models in it and so on
sample-006585,they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
sample-006586,two horsemen waiting ahead of them
sample-006587,and then he perceived it very slowly
sample-006588,the old man gave a signal and everyone stood
sample-006589,if you can concentrate always on the present you'll be a happy man
sample-006590,well i'd like to see their land and see how they live said his son
sample-006591,thanks for the clarification
sample-006592,maybe she didn't even remember him
sample-006593,he just got a new kite for his birthday
sample-006594,the boy was surprised at his thoughts
sample-006595,drink and enjoy yourself said the alchemist noticing that the boy was feeling happier
sample-006596,there was no way to measure anything of that length
sample-006597,something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top
sample-006598,she set it on the shelf and there it stayed
sample-006599,it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-006601,not everyone can see his dreams come true in the same way
sample-006602,but that's what they gave me
sample-006603,the people were also praying to heaven for protection
sample-006604,did you find it
sample-006605,bill decided that management should know about this incident
sample-006606,it brought his heart into his mouth
sample-006607,people saw me coming and welcomed me he thought
sample-006608,all things are one the boy thought
sample-006609,if i'm on the march i just concentrate on marching
sample-006610,the cup handle has broken
sample-006611,he was selling better than ever
sample-006612,they're not my sheep anymore he said to himself without nostalgia
sample-006613,how would you like to get a ticket next week
sample-006615,he's the only husband i've got
sample-006616,that night there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet
sample-006617,even though the sheep didn't teach me to speak arabic
sample-006618,they stood there looking at the moon
sample-006619,that's why i'm here
sample-006620,the boss sent me over with it
sample-006621,his heart was heavy and he had been melancholy since the previous night
sample-006622,but you know that i'm not going to go to mecca
sample-006623,the boy didn't want to talk about the pyramids
sample-006624,pull the hook to toggle the jukebox
sample-006625,toward the end of the afternoon they came upon a coptic monastery
sample-006626,you're probably weak from hunger
sample-006627,and don't forget the language of omens
sample-006629,he just got a new kite for his birthday
sample-006630,the oasis is neutral ground
sample-006631,there was no excuse for goodman to fly off the handle
sample-006632,you can't offer me something that is already mine the chief said arrogantly
sample-006633,i'd like you to take me there if you can
sample-006634,he stood irresolute for a moment and then scrambled out of the pit
sample-006635,what's all this mess
sample-006636,and he told what he had seen
sample-006637,it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
sample-006638,the caravans had been stopped at giza for some time waiting for the wars to end
sample-006639,i finally have enough money and all the time i need
sample-006640,everyone seemed very excited
sample-006641,i didn't know whose it was
sample-006642,i myself heard nothing of that
sample-006643,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
sample-006644,they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
sample-006645,and maybe it wasn't that they were teaching me but that i was learning from them
sample-006646,according to the recipe we need mild mustard
sample-006647,there was a fluctuation in the water pressure that fed the whale tank
sample-006650,if he ever decided to leave them they would suffer
sample-006651,i could have drawn this picture
sample-006652,i think it's about bird hunting but now i can see how that might be misinterpreted
sample-006653,most meteorites are more or less rounded
sample-006654,i haven't heard the baby complain yet
sample-006655,judge clark found this disagreement difficult to resolve
sample-006656,the boy had noticed that the englishman was irritable and missed his books
sample-006657,i'd know that voice anywhere
sample-006668,but don't you think he's just beautiful
sample-006669,he should have decided to become a shepherd the boy said
sample-006678,the top had certainly ceased to rotate
sample-006679,the englishman didn't answer him directly
sample-006680,and you know it
sample-006681,because for him you are a green field from which he always returns with game
sample-006682,somebody's going to get hurt
sample-006683,looking through the telescope i saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet
sample-006684,the hull of the ship collapsed
sample-006685,people saw me coming and welcomed me he thought
sample-006686,once to the thief and once to the general
sample-006687,it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
sample-006690,they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
sample-006691,that's never happened to me the boy said
sample-006692,between roast beef and potatoes how can we lose
sample-006693,the caravan would be very lucky to reach the oasis
sample-006694,i told you that your dream was a difficult one
sample-006695,i didn't mean to shoot him
sample-006696,this was the strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space
sample-006697,an old man with a breastplate of gold wouldn't have lied just to acquire six sheep
sample-006708,the englishman had been profoundly impressed by the story
sample-006709,the boy was startled
sample-006718,the greatest authority on meteorites stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles
sample-006719,i wished i had a light to smoke by
sample-006720,maktub thought the boy
sample-006721,afraid it might rain
sample-006722,that's the magic of omens said the boy
sample-006723,let's start with jumping to a particular line
sample-006724,the sword didn't fall
sample-006725,but she said nothing
sample-006726,strange images passed through my mind
sample-006727,the boy's name was santiago
sample-006730,revenge is not my style but obviously accidents will happen
sample-006731,tomorrow morning at ten o'clock
sample-006732,if you start your emails with greetings let me be the first to welcome you to earth
sample-006733,i wish they were rabbits
sample-006734,i myself heard nothing of that
sample-006735,she just stepped out
sample-006736,i'll show those guys
sample-006737,how long is what
sample-006740,turkey for thanksgiving
sample-006741,bakers have homes while shepherds sleep out in the open
sample-006742,because life wants you to achieve your destiny
sample-006743,and seizing the boy's bag the alchemist gave the gold coins to the chief
sample-006744,i used to live near el cairum he said
sample-006745,then we can go up to the falls
sample-006746,maybe she didn't even remember him
sample-006747,it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-006748,what do you think of that
sample-006749,that night he told all of this to the alchemist
sample-006750,i don't know why
sample-006751,you seem to think i've never done this before
sample-006752,the greatest authority on meteorites stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles
sample-006753,but finally he agreed that the boy who spoke better arabic than he should do so
sample-006754,because you have already lost your savings twice
sample-006755,but everything that happens twice will surely happen a third time
sample-006756,what is love the desert asked
sample-006757,it was not clear who had the right of way since the traffic lights were off
sample-006758,without the dataset the article would be meaningless
sample-006759,in alchemy it's called the soul of the world
sample-006760,i was wondering if you would work on this project with me because i cant find anyone else
sample-006761,that can't be true
sample-006762,are you going to let her out
sample-006763,my seven year resume gap is marked not drugs
sample-006764,the heat lasted until nightfall and all that time he had to carry his jacket
sample-006765,continue in the direction of the pyramids said the alchemist
sample-006766,but before i go i want to tell you a little story
sample-006767,i was just in town earlier this year so it is kind of crazy to think about what took place right after
sample-006768,is it a deal or isn't it
sample-006769,the tractor was bearing down hard
sample-006770,i avoid this entirely but i don't force the commands to be in a separate utterance
sample-006771,i got it back
sample-006772,i wished i had a light to smoke by
sample-006773,for the third quarter in succession the company didn't manage to leave red numbers
sample-006774,just teach me to be the wind for a few moments the boy said
sample-006775,and i'd like to have it
sample-006776,hires two personal trainers and make one of them train the other one
sample-006777,absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
sample-006778,it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
sample-006779,the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
sample-006780,he's already got charge of the bank
sample-006781,he approached the mass and was surprised at the size and the shape
sample-006782,she supports a mother and two kids
sample-006783,the boy didn't know what a person's destiny was
sample-006784,history teaches us that humans do not learn from history
sample-006785,maybe he'll give us one
sample-006786,what makes you think they're even interested
sample-006787,i hope nobody finds out we've been here
sample-006788,he listened to the wind and felt the stones beneath his feet
sample-006789,this morning i found a calculator taped to my wii
sample-006790,i don't know what she's talking about
sample-006791,the boy turned to the hand that wrote all
sample-006792,why the shots stopped after the tenth no one on earth has tried to explain
sample-006793,from there he could see africa in the distance
sample-006794,this morning i found a calculator taped to my wii
sample-006795,they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
sample-006796,the guy thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to stop him
sample-006797,i have to find a man who knows that universal language
sample-006798,i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
sample-006799,the cinema was abandoned
sample-006800,if my stepfather sold this old sculpture he'd probably become a millionaire
sample-006801,they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
sample-006802,there's the professor now
sample-006803,the one you're blocking
sample-006804,tomorrow at this same time bring me a tenth of your flock
sample-006805,thanks for the story and good luck on your honeymoon
sample-006806,we're coming to a new order of things
sample-006807,the next day the boy returned to the well hoping to see the girl
sample-006808,but the boy was too frightened to listen to words of wisdom
sample-006809,my tax dollars pay for those public school proms
sample-006810,and the names of the people involved were very difficult to pronounce
sample-006811,you don't think i'm gonna tell
sample-006812,the angel touched the man's shoulder and they were both projected far into the future
sample-006813,she set it on the shelf and there it stayed
sample-006814,and don't forget the language of omens
sample-006815,had our instruments permitted it we might have been able to see the trouble way back when
sample-006816,he was tense and upset because he knew that the old man was right
sample-006817,and if you improve on the present what comes later will also be better
sample-006818,this makes me feel funny
sample-006819,the one in there
sample-006820,the peak of this mountain is over two thousand meters above sea level
sample-006821,at this hour of the morning
sample-006822,and i think it's terrific
sample-006823,the old man wore a breastplate of gold and he knew about my past
sample-006824,he could see that the old man wanted to know more about his life
sample-006825,a large piece suddenly came off and fell with a loud and sharp noise
sample-006826,he knew what i was thinking the boy said to himself
sample-006828,i don't want anything else in life
sample-006829,they formed heaps that are visible a mile and a half away
sample-006830,the boy turned to the hand that wrote all
sample-006831,he wanted to say so to the alchemist but he was afraid of the man
sample-006832,uncle jack and i are going to miss you
sample-006834,i shall make us some ice cubes
sample-006835,the boy could certainly resist causing that kind of anxiety for the baker
sample-006836,as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
sample-006837,never advertise razors by shaving a monkey it's cruel and results in lawsuits
sample-006838,he suggested that the boy look around the palace and return in two hours
sample-006839,but the boy never took his eye off his new friend
sample-006848,maktub the boy said remembering the crystal merchant
sample-006849,i want to get back to my sheep faster
sample-006858,down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
sample-006859,before the boy could reply a butterfly appeared and fluttered between him and the old man
sample-006860,even if you cleaned my crystal for an entire year
sample-006861,two years ago right here on this spot i had a recurrent dream too
sample-006862,don't they usually keep the gun on the floor
sample-006863,i used to live near el cairum he said
sample-006864,they were fascinating stories each of them lived out his destiny to the end
sample-006865,but he still couldn't flee
sample-006866,there are many languages spoken by things the boy said
sample-006867,and then he perceived it very slowly
sample-006870,and at that i told him and he took my place
sample-006871,as soon as he saw me among the crowd he called to me to come down
sample-006872,that was his work
sample-006873,i don't much like change he said
sample-006874,but he decided to take a chance
sample-006875,hundreds must have seen it and taken it for a falling star
sample-006876,doughnuts are best with strawberry sprinkles and coffee
sample-006877,too bad he has to be fed on a bottle
sample-006888,you'll watch them as they grow demonstrating how the world is always changing
sample-006889,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
sample-006898,the next day the boy returned to the well hoping to see the girl
sample-006899,the driver got knocked cold
sample-006900,but now the sounds inside had stopped
sample-006901,she wrote the stuff
sample-006902,she knows that men have to go away in order to return
sample-006903,the printer stopped working
sample-006904,how does anything like this ever start
sample-006905,the wind's curiosity was aroused something that had never happened before
sample-006906,it was faintly marked with transverse stripes and slightly flattened from the perfect round
sample-006907,it would have been visible to me had i only looked up as it passed
sample-006910,heads popping back behind doors
sample-006911,they're just a pile of stones
sample-006912,jim thinks it's morgan
sample-006913,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
sample-006914,'m all about those invisible cosmic connections that transcend time and distance
sample-006915,i just want to dream about mecca
sample-006916,drawing from my own experience as a learner of english and german i value engaging activities that involve everyday conversation
sample-006917,i locked eyes with a fish in the tank
sample-006928,a friend had told the boy about the shop and he had taken his sheep there
sample-006929,that he wanted to travel
sample-006938,it's the emerald tablet said the englishman proud that he might teach something to the boy
sample-006939,you wanna take this outside
sample-006940,replace the ts in tim tebow's name with any other consonant to get a star wars character
sample-006941,this is the morning post you're talking to
sample-006942,i want to see him do it said the chief
sample-006943,everywhere there were stalls with items for sale
sample-006944,during one of these conversations the driver told of his own life
sample-006945,revenge is not my style but obviously accidents will happen
sample-006946,that day he didn't make a cast
sample-006947,maybe this is an omen said the englishman half aloud
sample-006948,suddenly one of the hawks made a flashing dive through the sky attacking the other
sample-006949,the boy reminded the old man that he had said something about hidden treasure
sample-006950,i was impatient to see it opened
sample-006951,i'd die for either of you
sample-006952,you'll find us everywhere
sample-006953,just by looking at them
sample-006954,i think i found something
sample-006955,in order to find the treasure you will have to follow the omens
sample-006956,you called that number not ten minutes ago
sample-006957,it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
sample-006958,i have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk which was embedded in the ground
sample-006959,i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
sample-006960,and what do you do in salem he insisted
sample-006961,the sheep fidgeted nearby uneasy with their new owner and excited by so much change
sample-006962,none of what the old man was saying made much sense to the boy
sample-006963,when will we grow out of fidget spinners
sample-006964,they crossed the desert for another two days in silence
sample-006965,replace the ts in tim tebow's name with any other consonant to get a star wars character
sample-006966,i was just in town earlier this year so it is kind of crazy to think about what took place right after
sample-006967,he must be disguised to avoid encounters with thieves
sample-006968,in those days very few of the people had any idea about astronomy
sample-006969,did you say a king he asked
sample-006970,she got the congressional medal of honor
sample-006971,he thought of the merchant's daughter and was sure that she had probably married
sample-006972,i am following my destiny
sample-006973,i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
sample-006974,the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
sample-006975,it's extremely suspicious that there's no information about brains that didn't come from a brain
sample-006976,i thought sure you'd remember me
sample-006977,and then he perceived it very slowly
sample-006978,none of this ha d made an impression on the boy
sample-006979,good playgrounds have much more to offer than swings and slides
sample-006980,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
sample-006981,let's get out of here said the new arrival
sample-006982,the caravans had been stopped at giza for some time waiting for the wars to end
sample-006983,my mind ran on the possibilities of its content
sample-006984,the boy felt a pang in his heart thinking about the merchant's daughter
sample-006985,i believe that this is not explained in the text
sample-006986,maybe this is an omen said the englishman half aloud
sample-006987,a hundred nuns stampeded the vatican
sample-006988,drink and enjoy yourself said the alchemist noticing that the boy was feeling happier
sample-006989,the atmosphere was suffused with the sweet scent of smoke
sample-006990,the little group of people from the city dispersed
sample-006991,you wanna take this outside
sample-006992,you must understand that love never keeps a man from pursuing his destiny
sample-006993,i've been very busy the last few weeks
sample-006994,times are different now
sample-006995,to realize one's destiny is a person's only real obligation
sample-006996,the women took turns building a tall stable pile of rocks
sample-006997,the invaders carried the name everywhere the beautiful girl spoke of the invaders with pride
sample-006998,they can't use the jena doug clubs for politics
sample-006999,on the following day the first clear sign of danger appeared
sample-007000,it was something that i thought could happen only to others never to me
sample-007001,with every day that passed the boy's heart became more and more silent
sample-007002,i've already told you
sample-007003,everything in life is an omen said the englishman now closing the journal he was reading
sample-007004,tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself
sample-007005,he had never even wept in front of his own sheep
sample-007006,another person was there to help him toward his destiny
sample-007007,the camel driver though seemed not to be very concerned with the threat of war
sample-007010,the trees swayed uniformly in the breeze
sample-007011,the infidels had an evil look about them
sample-007012,the boy was relieved
sample-007013,watch over her tonight
sample-007014,the boy watched the exchange with fascination
sample-007015,some of the grey ash was falling off the circular edge
sample-007016,the newspaper articles had prepared everyone for the reception of the idea
sample-007017,mostly just the hearts of those who are trying to realize their destinies
sample-007028,he reached over and picked up a shell from the ground
sample-007029,he had not a cent in his pocket but he had faith
sample-007038,you were seen at the enemy camp three days ago
sample-007039,from the railway station in the distance came the sound of trains ringing and rumbling
sample-007040,sometimes i get so mad at you i can't see straight
sample-007041,we can't leave greg here
sample-007042,no one can be from many places the boy said
sample-007043,i don't want to rush you
sample-007044,let's go and have some lunch said the crystal merchant
sample-007045,the burning fire had been extinguished
sample-007046,it was the levanter the wind that came from africa
sample-007047,he got up early with the idea of finding it
sample-007048,i heard a faint movement under my feet
sample-007049,now his intuition was that he had been right in coming
sample-007050,as he looked at the stones he felt relieved for some reason
sample-007051,the sun was turned into a golden disk
sample-007052,i'm observing passiveaggressive behavior the psychologist said in a professional tone
sample-007053,now i will drift gently off to dreamland
sample-007054,some went away while i was there and other people came
sample-007055,henderson was taking it in
sample-007056,dennis was not a business man
sample-007057,i don't want anything else in life
sample-007058,his last words were never heard
sample-007059,but that was simply because my eye was tired
sample-007060,but he kept the sword in his hand
sample-007061,if i told you it might not come true
sample-007062,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
sample-007063,somewhere you are holding the person i love the boy said
sample-007064,my review of the sun one star
sample-007065,fatima is a woman of the desert said the alchemist
sample-007066,he thought of the merchant's daughter and was sure that she had probably married
sample-007067,i want to do something big and something important
sample-007068,there was a small building there with a window at which people bought tickets to africa
sample-007069,a large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered
sample-007070,and got it out as soon as you can
sample-007071,i think we were wrong about sally having the money
sample-007072,that circus acrobat must have a welltrained vestibular system the spectator thought
sample-007073,because of the omens the alchemist answered
sample-007074,she keeps saying that she has no regrets about moving back home but im not sure if its entirely true
sample-007075,when i returned to the common the sun was setting
sample-007076,to do that successfully i must have no fear of failure
sample-007077,it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
sample-007078,it must have fallen while i was sitting over there
sample-007079,your luck's not with you now
sample-007080,the treasure is at the pyramids that you already knew
sample-007081,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
sample-007082,two days ago you said that i had never dreamed of travel the merchant answered
sample-007083,here i am between my flock and my treasure the boy thought
sample-007084,the man looked at the angel in surprise
sample-007085,you'll be the counselor of the oasis
sample-007086,he had seen kings and beggars walking the desert sands
sample-007087,it was faintly marked with transverse stripes and slightly flattened from the perfect round
sample-007088,all i saw was an army said the boy
sample-007089,it was faintly marked with transverse stripes and slightly flattened from the perfect round
sample-007090,absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
sample-007091,there was nothing to hold him back except himself
sample-007092,but that was simply because my eye was tired
sample-007093,i can see what happens backstage through this aperture
sample-007094,i'm talking about the building and loan
sample-007095,i went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the dark
sample-007096,you have told me about your dreams about the old king and your treasure
sample-007097,he hoped that it would be someone as capable as his previous apprentice
sample-007098,the agent secretly entered the embassy from the roof
sample-007099,it was our money and we want it back
sample-007100,death doesn't change anything the boy thought
sample-007101,i've already had that experience with my sheep and now it's happening with people
sample-007102,he had understood the story the old king had told him
sample-007103,you'll use your knowledge for the welfare of the oasis and its inhabitants
sample-007104,i saw a young man standing on the cylinder and trying to scramble out of the hole again
sample-007105,it would help the reader to understand your method better
sample-007106,i almost dropped him
sample-007107,but they were not there
sample-007108,i'm going to wait here for you every day
sample-007109,they went to the kitchen at the back of the monastery
sample-007110,it was the first time she had done that
sample-007111,i can always go back to being a shepherd the boy thought
sample-007112,you can't desert now
sample-007113,who did you talk to
sample-007114,i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
sample-007115,no that's not what i mean
sample-007116,a citation wasn't needed
sample-007117,he thought of the woman who had trusted in the desert
sample-007118,so he asked if the old man's blessing was still with him
sample-007119,a monk dressed in black came to the gates
sample-007120,i heard what you were talking about the other day with the alchemist the wind said
sample-007121,tourists in socks and sandals look hilarious
sample-007122,but that was simply because my eye was tired
sample-007123,the clock was slightly askew
sample-007124,they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
sample-007125,and ask for a glass of wine for me
sample-007126,she said linda did it
sample-007127,the omens had told him so
sample-007128,most meteorites are more or less rounded
sample-007129,they were on the right track
sample-007130,i couldnt stop staring at it
sample-007131,they set off running wildly into the trees
sample-007132,three taps is me
sample-007133,i am definitely open to the idea because ive always wanted to work as a small business owner
sample-007134,then she filled her vessel with water and left
sample-007135,do you want to go to work for me the merchant asked
sample-007136,the arabs laughed at him and the alchemist laughed along
sample-007137,and what a way to quit
sample-007138,don't you dare to be civil with me
sample-007139,in general people have difficulties estimating risks correctly
sample-007148,he was immensely excited at the news
sample-007149,there were thirty girls on the soccer field
sample-007158,it's called the principle of favorability
sample-007159,it swayed in the air like weeping willows
sample-007160,gypsies are experts at getting people to do that sighed the old man
sample-007161,is this the place
sample-007162,are you going to go to julia's
sample-007163,he thought about asking him to give it back but decided that would be unfriendly
sample-007164,it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
sample-007165,for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
sample-007166,it would have been visible to me had i only looked up as it passed
sample-007167,but you know that i'm not going to go to mecca
sample-007170,i can see that right now
sample-007171,plastic surgery has become more popular
sample-007172,but he had found a guide and didn't want to miss out on an opportunity
sample-007173,in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
sample-007174,is that any good
sample-007175,when he reached the top of the dune his heart leapt
sample-007176,all that time the martians must have been getting ready
sample-007177,the men fell into an animated discussion
sample-007188,i'll return just as your father came back to your mother he said
sample-007189,no one seemed to have thought about it that night
sample-007198,this wasn't a strange place it was a new one
sample-007199,if you don't stop following me i'll call the police
sample-007200,come out of there
sample-007201,some went away while i was there and other people came
sample-007202,i told you that your dream was a difficult one
sample-007203,men dream more about coming home than about leaving the boy said
sample-007204,from the railway station in the distance came the sound of trains ringing and rumbling
sample-007205,i'd better hustle him up
sample-007206,two years ago right here on this spot i had a recurrent dream too
sample-007207,why didn't you tell me
sample-007210,if you pay attention to the present you can improve upon it
sample-007211,the end of the cylinder was still as ogilvy and henderson had left it
sample-007212,about an hour ago
sample-007213,now i will drift gently off to dreamland
sample-007214,but i found it difficult to get to work because of the investigations
sample-007215,maybe he'll give us one
sample-007216,and above all don't forget to follow your destiny through to its conclusion
sample-007217,my shampoo is made from coconut and sweet almond
sample-007228,it's not i the wind spoke about
sample-007229,i'd like to build a display case for the crystal the boy said to the merchant
sample-007238,apple pie is an iconic dish
sample-007239,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
sample-007240,i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit
sample-007241,and the murmur lasted longer than a simple vow would have
sample-007242,and the names of the people involved were very difficult to pronounce
sample-007243,he took out his money and counted it
sample-007245,this biscuit is yummy
sample-007246,you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
sample-007247,like eating or sleeping or like seeking love or finding a job
sample-007248,i went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the dark
sample-007249,he really doesn't look so bad
sample-007251,he was immensely excited at the news
sample-007252,the book was written in spanish
sample-007253,do you have any secret hiding place here in the house
sample-007254,it seemed such a little thing so bright and small and still
sample-007255,you can keep her on
sample-007256,my friend bought all the other sheep immediately
sample-007257,i want you to be my wife
sample-007258,because the crystal was dirty
sample-007259,once to the thief and once to the general
sample-007260,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
sample-007261,dense clouds of smoke or dust can be seen through a powerful telescope
sample-007262,the day was hot and the wine was refreshing
sample-007263,the biggest living thing is a mushroom
sample-007264,you wanna take this outside
sample-007265,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
sample-007266,but they were not there
sample-007267,they didn't have the printing press in those days the boy argued
sample-007268,take hold of the cover
sample-007269,no baselines or comparison to state of the art is provided
sample-007270,do you know what an engagement ring is
sample-007271,your money saved us for three days
sample-007272,what were you doing in boston
sample-007273,the alchemist is two hundred years old the englishman had told him
sample-007274,when did you get back
sample-007275,what good is money to you if you're going to die
sample-007276,it was only when i got this close to it that the strangeness of it was at all evident to me
sample-007277,he looked like an arab which was not unusual in those parts
sample-007279,the alchemist probably already knew all that
sample-007280,it's not my house
sample-007281,it was a a kind of fascination that paralysed my actions
sample-007282,because you will never again be able to keep it quiet
sample-007283,it seemed as if what the old king had called beginner's luck were no longer functioning
sample-007284,it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
sample-007285,the sheep is the wolf of sheep
sample-007286,he's home cooking dinner
sample-007288,you don't have to be rich skinny popular or even own a cape to perform a random act of kindness
sample-007289,the boy approached her to ask about the alchemist
sample-007290,then the thing came upon him in a flash
sample-007291,the stranger was speaking of things that very few people knew about
sample-007292,you're losing your eye
sample-007294,the invaders carried the name everywhere the beautiful girl spoke of the invaders with pride
sample-007295,the alchemist erased the circle in the sand and the snake slithered away among the rocks
sample-007296,the boy accustomed to recognizing omens spoke to the merchant
sample-007297,ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
sample-007298,i find this ferry boring
sample-007299,i pointed out mars a bright dot of light
sample-007300,the boy waited and then interrupted the old man just as he himself had been interrupted
sample-007301,the englishman was disappointed
sample-007302,how much does this cost
sample-007303,we've done it said the englishman who had also awakened early
sample-007304,they must be used to their new shepherd and have probably already forgotten me
sample-007305,dee's house right now
sample-007306,a large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered
sample-007307,my mind ran on the possibilities of its content
sample-007308,i hold the power of life and death for every person i take with me
sample-007309,they become a part of everything
sample-007310,i'd like to think
sample-007311,they locked themselves in their laboratories and tried to evolve as gold had
sample-007312,there was enough there to buy a lot of weapons
sample-007313,where is the treasure he asked
sample-007314,he got up early with the idea of finding it
sample-007315,sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
sample-007316,is daddy in trouble
sample-007317,wrapped in a scarf and blinded by the blizzard the boy scrambled for the subway
sample-007318,how do you mean
sample-007319,a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder
sample-007320,at the first glance it was really not very exciting
sample-007321,many telescopes were pointed at it
sample-007322,as i will describe in another post i run an http server
sample-007323,i think you're crazy
sample-007324,they don't see that the fields are new and the seasons change
sample-007325,there was a thud like the fall of a great mass
sample-007326,all you have to remember is to be sincere
sample-007327,the sheep fidgeted nearby uneasy with their new owner and excited by so much change
sample-007328,the sunset faded into twilight before anything else happened
sample-007329,at the first glance it was really not very exciting
sample-007330,when she saw the unknown object bobbing up and down the edge she was absolutely horrified
sample-007331,he rose and made his way back toward the palm trees
sample-007332,from there he could see africa in the distance
sample-007333,it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-007334,why do people have to tell lies
sample-007335,i'm going to find that damned alchemist the englishman thought
sample-007336,but they were not there
sample-007337,you dominated those horsemen with the way you looked at them he said
sample-007338,sure see you there
sample-007339,i'm trying to explain to my mother how to get pictures off her phone
sample-007348,you'll be the counselor of the oasis
sample-007349,the thought was so dreadful to him that he forgot about the heat and went forward
sample-007358,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
sample-007359,the simum blew that day as it had never blown before
sample-007360,haven't you even started
sample-007361,when were these books written the boy asked
sample-007362,that first day everyone slept from exhaustion including the englishman
sample-007363,night fell and an assortment of fighting men and merchants entered and exited the tent
sample-007364,her best gesture of sympathy was a handwritten note
sample-007365,they set off running wildly into the trees
sample-007366,then suddenly he noticed it with a start
sample-007367,and what do you do in salem he insisted
sample-007370,they're always after me for interviews
sample-007371,stanley felt exhilarated
sample-007372,it has happened many times before
sample-007373,it's like the camel driver said 'eat when it's time to eat
sample-007374,don't forget that everything you deal with is only one thing and nothing else
sample-007375,what's your name he asked
sample-007376,well it's a long list
sample-007377,everything in life is an omen said the englishman now closing the journal he was reading
sample-007388,they started right in bribing me
sample-007389,but he certainly didn't desire that an army invade the oasis
sample-007398,do you know what cia stands for
sample-007399,then he took from his knapsack a bottle of wine and drank some
sample-007400,it was the levanter the wind that came from africa
sample-007401,that was a little girl named mary hatch
sample-007402,he got up early with the idea of finding it
sample-007403,that this house may never know hunger
sample-007404,i hate to think what he'll say
sample-007405,how did you find out
sample-007406,i'm going to guide you across the desert the alchemist said
sample-007407,the invaders carried the name everywhere the beautiful girl spoke of the invaders with pride
sample-007410,maktub thought the boy
sample-007411,he started to read the book he had bought
sample-007412,i lost my wallet
sample-007413,i want to see the chieftains
sample-007414,maybe the alchemist has never been in love the boy thought
sample-007415,lindsey promised to call you from new york tonight
sample-007416,the plastic barrier shattered
sample-007417,who did you talk to
sample-007428,it's a terrible reflection on our city
sample-007429,even then he hardly understood what this meant
sample-007438,when the sun sets the men will once again surrender their arms to me
sample-007439,i'm going to them
sample-007440,at the same time people were passing my shop all the time heading for mecca
sample-007441,give me some carrots and other vegetables i'm going to feed the rabbits
sample-007442,i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
sample-007443,the tribal chieftains will appreciate what you do
sample-007444,that brings you good luck for ten years
sample-007445,only us explorers can get it
sample-007446,in those days very few of the people had any idea about astronomy
sample-007447,before this i always looked to the desert with longing said fatima
sample-007448,he dressed in his arabian clothing of white linen bought especially for this day
sample-007449,the end of the cylinder was still as ogilvy and henderson had left it
sample-007450,she's good enough for me
sample-007451,we miss you and miss having a friend like you and i am so happy that you two got to catch up
sample-007452,that's exactly what i thought
sample-007453,i'm going to tell your mother on you
sample-007454,who do you think writes them
sample-007455,has melanie scott been in the papers
sample-007456,what do you want to know
sample-007457,a friend had told the boy about the shop and he had taken his sheep there
sample-007458,even though the sheep didn't teach me to speak arabic
sample-007459,a large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered
sample-007460,it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience
sample-007461,but if you can try to make your own decisions
sample-007462,i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
sample-007463,never stop dreaming the old king had said
sample-007464,the rocking motion was nauseating
sample-007465,coming home a party of tourists passed us singing and playing music
sample-007466,the place is so full of cockroaches
sample-007467,that first day everyone slept from exhaustion including the englishman
sample-007468,when i first reached through to it i thought the soul of the world was perfect
sample-007469,there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
sample-007470,can i get a woot woot
sample-007471,the hand that evokes love and creates a twin soul for every person in the world
sample-007472,sam's crazy about mick
sample-007473,he sat on a stone and allowed himself to become hypnotized by the horizon
sample-007474,his father said no more
sample-007475,the boy didn't know what to say
sample-007476,once to the thief and once to the general
sample-007477,who is responsible for these parrots
sample-007478,he just got a new kite for his birthday
sample-007479,the level ground was blackened as far as one could see and it was still giving off smoke
sample-007480,the report was largely scathing
sample-007481,they formed heaps that are visible a mile and a half away
sample-007482,the wind told me that you know about love the boy said to the sun
sample-007483,mrs ruth victor wants to see you
sample-007484,they never have to make any decisions he thought
sample-007485,this is the press room
sample-007486,i heard a faint movement under my feet
sample-007487,i have no information about troops or about the movement of the tribes
sample-007488,the two men hurried back and found the cylinder still lying in the same position
sample-007489,i have the diet of a kid who found twenty dollars
sample-007490,you shouldn't be here the alchemist answered
sample-007491,who's gonna get him
sample-007492,the sunset sometimes turns the sky red
sample-007493,i came to tell you just one thing the boy said
sample-007494,now i will drift gently off to dreamland
sample-007495,it knew of the boy's talk with the desert because the winds know everything
sample-007496,it's like the camel driver said 'eat when it's time to eat
sample-007497,this was the strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space
sample-007498,i have already found my treasure
sample-007499,while english is the standard language spoken in his country the united states of america has no official language
sample-007500,a current of love rushed from his heart and the boy began to pray
sample-007501,so he began to wander through the city and found himself at the gates
sample-007502,have trusted more in your love for fatima
sample-007503,the man looked at him without responding
sample-007504,you think you did
sample-007505,a line of flame high can be seen in the atmosphere
sample-007506,as the englishman left fatima arrived and filled her vessel with water
sample-007507,how does anything like this ever start
sample-007508,so he began to wander through the city and found himself at the gates
sample-007509,the greatest authority on meteorites stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles
sample-007510,when you start to eat like this something is the matter
sample-007511,the oasis is neutral ground
sample-007512,i need you to be spontaneous he asked me out to din din
sample-007513,at other times at a crucial moment i make it easier for things to happen
sample-007514,he knew nothing about the customs of the strange land he was in
sample-007515,it was a bundle of money
sample-007516,that's true enough the boy thought ruefully
sample-007517,well he thought about that the old man said
sample-007518,can you get in this desk
sample-007519,could have been on my way to old doc brown
sample-007520,then taking his sheep he walked away
sample-007521,replace the ts in tim tebow's name with any other consonant to get a star wars character
sample-007523,it's what you have always wanted to accomplish
sample-007524,the camel drivers exchanged information about windstorms and told stories about the desert
sample-007525,you don't call this a convenience
sample-007526,when he reached the top of the dune his heart leapt
sample-007527,i'm surprised the boy said
sample-007528,it spoke of journeys discoveries books and change
sample-007529,and so despite the fact that he was a roman centurion he converted to their faith
sample-007530,but they could never have taught him arabic
sample-007531,how about some of that good spaghetti
sample-007532,this is what was written on the emerald tablet said the alchemist when he had finished
sample-007533,then you taught me something of the universal language and the soul of the world
sample-007534,they were known as seers and they were held in fear by women and the elderly
sample-007535,and don't forget the language of omens
sample-007537,i can see a smiling face in the clouds
sample-007538,all they ever do really is look for food and water
sample-007539,and he came down after the game with a contract
sample-007548,it was only when i got this close to it that the strangeness of it was at all evident to me
sample-007549,the englishman had several suitcases filled with books
sample-007558,i would have won the junior olympics if not for those medaling kids
sample-007559,the boy climbed the dune slowly
sample-007560,they reached the center of a large plaza where the market was held
sample-007561,the book was written in spanish
sample-007562,all who went there were happy at having done so
sample-007563,i've always looked on bessie as my own sister
sample-007564,there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
sample-007565,it was the time of day when all of spain slept during the summer
sample-007566,we lit the lantern and walked over to his house
sample-007567,he should have decided to become a shepherd the boy said
sample-007570,had our instruments permitted it we might have been able to see the trouble way back when
sample-007571,we've been taken for a lot of suckers
sample-007572,she enjoyed her weekend trip to the baltic sea
sample-007573,you must love the desert but never trust it completely
sample-007574,even then he hardly understood what this meant
sample-007575,he watched the hawks as they drifted on the wind
sample-007576,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
sample-007577,how much do you need
sample-007588,he lives at the alfayoum oasis his friend had said
sample-007589,he's pretty young for that job
sample-007598,i'm a desert woman and i'm proud of that
sample-007599,none of this ha d made an impression on the boy
sample-007600,the bench was long and strong
sample-007601,i'm going to them
sample-007602,the boy brought his horse closer
sample-007603,one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
sample-007604,i'm surprised the boy said
sample-007605,and this is your coat
sample-007606,and he decided he would go to see the chiefs of the tribes
sample-007607,you can't believe it's not butter
sample-007610,they continued across the desert
sample-007611,kenneth reacted badly to the steroids he's under observation for the next hour
sample-007612,it was however still so hot from its flight through the air
sample-007613,i pointed out mars a bright dot of light
sample-007614,the alchemist followed as the boy's horse ran for almost half an hour
sample-007615,i understand sheep they're no longer a problem and they can be good friends
sample-007616,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
sample-007617,the omens had told him so
sample-007628,a line of flame high can be seen in the atmosphere
sample-007629,if you pay attention to the present you can improve upon it
sample-007638,what is a foreigner doing here asked another of the men
sample-007639,did you get it
sample-007640,the tea seemed less bitter
sample-007641,it was the most delicious wine he had ever tasted
sample-007642,suddenly there is so much more time in a day because she no longer has to spend hours commuting
sample-007643,it's called the principle of favorability
sample-007644,why do you think i brought you here
sample-007645,and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
sample-007646,about eleven i walked back to my home in maybury because nothing seemed to be happening
sample-007647,they were all standing around when she wrote it
sample-007648,the boy knew a lot of people in the city
sample-007649,it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
sample-007650,but you know that i'm not going to go to mecca
sample-007651,and so will you
sample-007652,and don't wear your high hat
sample-007653,at once he connected the two incidents
sample-007654,i'm going to them
sample-007655,hires two personal trainers and make one of them train the other one
sample-007656,they were surrounded by children curious to look at the animals and people that were arriving
sample-007657,he felt weighted down by the centuries of time since the pyramids had been built
sample-007658,i'm interested only in the present
sample-007659,a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder
sample-007660,i want to know what it is
sample-007661,and you ought to read more about the world answered the englishman
sample-007662,a large piece suddenly came off and fell with a loud and sharp noise
sample-007663,i can explain if you'll just listen
sample-007664,i bet you she'd know how to say it all right
sample-007665,i don't know where to go
sample-007666,it was however still so hot from its flight through the air
sample-007667,you got someplace to sleep
sample-007668,they were people of the desert and clamored to hear his stories about the great cities
sample-007669,it was difficult not to think about what he had left behind
sample-007670,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
sample-007671,the boy thanked him ate it and went on his way
sample-007672,whenever we wanted we could see him
sample-007673,the shop is exactly the size i always wanted it to be
sample-007674,the nearby city of ceuta had grown faster than tangier and business had fallen off
sample-007675,maybe because that wasn't really his dream
sample-007676,better let me talk to him
sample-007677,it was hard for him to eat less because the food was so good
sample-007678,he looked around at the empty plaza again feeling less desperate than before
sample-007679,we could get to the pyramids by tomorrow said the other taking the money
sample-007680,continue in the direction of the pyramids said the alchemist
sample-007681,there was a time when for me a camel's whinnying was nothing more than whinnying
sample-007682,the guy thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to stop him
sample-007683,it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-007684,is this the place
sample-007685,i'm so hungry i could faint
sample-007686,but the alchemist continued to look to the horizon
sample-007687,be careful with your prognostications said the stranger
sample-007688,but who asked him
sample-007689,the falcon's beak carries bits of me myself the desert said
sample-007690,the wind approached the boy and touched his face
sample-007691,he had never even wept in front of his own sheep
sample-007692,this isn't for me to decide
sample-007693,maybe that's why they came
sample-007694,but if you have to go before then go on in pursuit of your dream
sample-007695,the soul of the world is nourished by people's happiness
sample-007696,there was very little talking
sample-007697,how do you think i got here
sample-007698,nobody knew who malcolm was
sample-007699,he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
sample-007700,i'm leaving today said the boy
sample-007701,i'll hang it up
sample-007702,they mounted their horses
sample-007703,i learned the alchemist's secrets in my travels
sample-007704,the alchemists spent years in their laboratories observing the fire that purified the metals
sample-007705,but everything had changed
sample-007706,they went out of business years ago
sample-007707,but the marketplace was empty and he was far from home so he wept
sample-007708,i could feel that they were hungry for something
sample-007709,i'll have ned write it up
sample-007710,what happened to your wings
sample-007711,he knew how to shear them and how to slaughter them
sample-007712,everything in the universe evolved he said
sample-007713,a whole week in bermuda
sample-007714,the boy said nothing
sample-007715,from the railway station in the distance came the sound of trains ringing and rumbling
sample-007716,it has happened many times before
sample-007717,the boy became fearful the omens told him that something was wrong
sample-007718,about eleven i walked back to my home in maybury because nothing seemed to be happening
sample-007719,do i look as funny as you do
sample-007720,there were three hundred wells fifty thousand date trees and innumerable colored tents spread among them
sample-007721,i'm going to guide you across the desert the alchemist said
sample-007722,can i get a woot woot
sample-007723,i know its dimensions and how it behaves
sample-007724,we always observe the tradition
sample-007725,does a man's heart always help him the boy asked the alchemist
sample-007726,i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit
sample-007727,johnathan assessed the situation carefully
sample-007728,well why don't we go there right now the boy asked
sample-007729,my calendar was full that month
sample-007730,is she running a temperature
sample-007731,those are the rules of war the leader explained
sample-007732,you've never been born
sample-007733,we've got to find him
sample-007734,the old man leafed through the book and fell to reading a page he came to
sample-007735,that's why i feel that i deserve a part of what you find
sample-007736,we don't know when the war will end so we can't continue our journey he said
sample-007737,and you can meet us at the station
sample-007738,how old are you
sample-007739,why the shots stopped after the tenth no one on earth has tried to explain
sample-007748,he was more confident in himself though and felt as though he could conquer the world
sample-007749,it's called the principle of favorability
sample-007758,will i learn to do that someday the boy asked
sample-007759,down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
sample-007760,i didn't want the publicity
sample-007761,haven't you even started
sample-007762,down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
sample-007763,these families have children
sample-007764,the shop was busy and the man asked the shepherd to wait until the afternoon
sample-007765,the snake fought frantically making hissing sounds that shattered the silence of the desert
sample-007766,we'll find you a hotel
sample-007767,i didn't see anything
sample-007770,ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
sample-007771,what does he do all day
sample-007772,he suddenly felt tremendously happy
sample-007773,it's true that everything has its destiny but one day that destiny will be realized
sample-007774,he was about the same age and height as the boy
sample-007775,treason is a blow that comes unexpectedly
sample-007776,i have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk which was embedded in the ground
sample-007777,don't say those things
sample-007788,they set off running wildly into the trees
sample-007789,all this happened between sunrise and sunset the boy thought
sample-007798,then one day the boy returned the books to the englishman
sample-007799,is there a crowd in the street
sample-007808,you telephoned me to meet you
sample-007809,but then i realized she couldn't have been
sample-007818,but don't let that out of your sight
sample-007819,it's true that everything has its destiny but one day that destiny will be realized
sample-007820,i went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the dark
sample-007821,the woman said she had never heard of such a person and hurried away
sample-007822,there was nothing to hold him back except himself
sample-007823,it's too bad that he's quickly going to forget my name he thought
sample-007824,the end of the cylinder was still as ogilvy and henderson had left it
sample-007825,in one he had read that many years ago a famous arabian alchemist had visited europe
sample-007826,i shall make us some ice cubes
sample-007827,grandpa is always so calm and collected
sample-007830,that's the way it always is said the old man
sample-007831,do you know what's wrong with you
sample-007832,it'd be too late
sample-007833,let me tell you what will happen
sample-007834,did she discuss it with you
sample-007835,how are you doing today
sample-007836,my keyboard is filled with dust
sample-007837,he didn't know the man yet but his practiced eye would recognize him when he appeared
sample-007840,sticks and stones will break my bones but what doesn't kill me makes me strong
sample-007841,you got your sea legs yet
sample-007842,what are you doing up here then
sample-007843,bakers have homes while shepherds sleep out in the open
sample-007844,this puts me in a peculiar hole
sample-007845,now i want you to sign this agreement
sample-007846,maybe she didn't even remember him
sample-007847,we're just travelers the alchemist answered
sample-007848,we lit the lantern and walked over to his house
sample-007849,about eleven i walked back to my home in maybury because nothing seemed to be happening
sample-007850,it was a cobra whose venom could kill a person in minutes
sample-007851,and the nightgown had changed into a beautiful wedding gown
sample-007852,the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees
sample-007853,the boy preferred wine
sample-007854,i've learned things from the sheep and i've learned things from crystal he thought
sample-007855,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
sample-007856,but now the sounds inside had stopped
sample-007857,there was nothing to hold him back except himself
sample-007858,and at that i told him and he took my place
sample-007859,that's what killed him
sample-007860,i understand sheep they're no longer a problem and they can be good friends
sample-007861,you must always know what it is that you want the old king had said
sample-007862,he's probably trying the gate
sample-007863,let me talk to him
sample-007864,we heard a lot of yelling
sample-007865,who's got the room next to hers
sample-007866,will you try to get some sleep
sample-007867,a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder
sample-007868,so you know about love the boy said
sample-007869,as the sun rose the men began to beat the boy
sample-007870,at that point the omens will tell you that your treasure is buried forever
sample-007871,whimsy is a difficult thing to capture
sample-007872,it brought his heart into his mouth
sample-007873,this wool jumper is itchy
sample-007874,its saturday its hot and i really want to try the dry ramen
sample-007875,i'm going to them
sample-007876,they went on smoking the pipe for a while as the sun began to set
sample-007877,don't let anybody in or out
sample-007878,i thought that was peter parker
sample-007879,heehaw and merry christmas
sample-007880,they locked themselves in their laboratories and tried to evolve as gold had
sample-007881,you will now retire to arrive at a verdict
sample-007882,he paused and his eyes were still unfriendly
sample-007883,who wants to see liver pills
sample-007884,my mother just called you
sample-007885,as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
sample-007886,carol saved her brother's life that day
sample-007887,but the merchant understood what the boy had said
sample-007888,this was the strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space
sample-007889,you don't know scott
sample-007890,who gets your vote
sample-007891,may i see it
sample-007892,take hold of the cover
sample-007893,it's too bad that he's quickly going to forget my name he thought
sample-007894,this guy stole my watch
sample-007895,astronomy might be complicated but it's not rocket science
sample-007896,then one day the boy returned the books to the englishman
sample-007897,where is the treasure he asked
sample-007898,but we've never had any real trouble
sample-007899,i wish they were rabbits
sample-007900,and the solid part was called the philosopher's stone
sample-007901,he told them all to be seated
sample-007902,it's called the principle of favorability
sample-007903,the boy recalled the brilliance he had noticed on the previous day
sample-007904,one afternoon they passed by the encampment of one of the tribes
sample-007905,he needs three days answered the alchemist
sample-007906,i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
sample-007907,all you've got to do is talk to him
sample-007908,the vision vanished immediately but it had shaken him
sample-007909,epilepsy is a condition which sends the sufferer into uncontrollable convulsions
sample-007910,everything on earth is being continuously transformed because the earth is alive
sample-007911,he employed the most cunning of tactics
sample-007912,you've got the money
sample-007913,it was dropping off in flakes and raining down on the sand
sample-007914,don't ask me why i don't know why
sample-007915,what was all that
sample-007916,before him was an enormous white horse rearing over him with a frightening scream
sample-007917,they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
sample-007918,never heard of such a thing
sample-007919,it was an oblong shape
sample-007920,what is an alchemist he asked finally
sample-007921,that night there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet
sample-007922,he got up early with the idea of finding it
sample-007923,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
sample-007924,you don't have to be rich skinny popular or even own a cape to perform a random act of kindness
sample-007925,what we need is fireworks
sample-007926,the old man wore a breastplate of gold and he knew about my past
sample-007927,but they're somebody's children
sample-007928,it's the only answer
sample-007929,i don't care what you say
sample-007930,the owner of the bar came over and looked as well
sample-007931,so how will we name all these hurricanes
sample-007932,but if you can try to make your own decisions
sample-007933,i get thirty dollars a week
sample-007934,the boy was astonished by what he saw inside
sample-007935,they set off running wildly into the trees
sample-007936,that's when he'll be safe and not a minute before
sample-007937,it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
sample-007938,mary told me that she got to meet up with you while she was back in san francisco
sample-007939,i had seen all that it would presently bring me
sample-007940,you can't believe it's not butter
sample-007941,he needed someone to talk to so as to avoid thinking about the possibility of war
sample-007942,i'm loving it
sample-007943,and then the boy understood
sample-007944,they set off running wildly into the trees
sample-007945,he won't quit his paper without giving notice after this
sample-007946,but can we trust him
sample-007947,go and speak to the tribal chieftains said the camel driver
sample-007950,a boy came running towards me
sample-007951,but the crystal merchant had no choice
sample-007952,where do you come from
sample-007953,he remembered something his grandfather had once told him that butterflies were a good omen
sample-007954,the boy fell to his knees and wept
sample-007955,before the boy could reply a butterfly appeared and fluttered between him and the old man
sample-007956,bert the cop was wounded in north africa
sample-007957,it's a simple story
sample-007968,an alchemist said the alchemist
sample-007969,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
sample-007978,the englishman was disappointed
sample-007979,you'd better get dressed
sample-007980,and then he perceived it very slowly
sample-007981,hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after
sample-007982,i used to look at those women and envy them their happiness
sample-007983,death doesn't change anything the boy thought
sample-007984,he remembered what the old man had said about offering something you didn't even have yet
sample-007985,he was selling better than ever
sample-007986,some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound
sample-007987,people continued to come and go from the baker's shop
sample-007990,and did you put the envelope in your pocket
sample-007991,a breeze began to blow
sample-007992,toffee coated all the surfaces it was disgustingly sticky
sample-007993,the newspaper articles had prepared everyone for the reception of the idea
sample-007994,there is a universal language understood by everybody but already forgotten
sample-007995,am i talking too much
sample-007996,the burning fire had been extinguished
sample-007997,the old man opened his cape and the boy was struck by what he saw
sample-008000,this is for the boy
sample-008001,when were these books written the boy asked
sample-008002,the letter said that the payment was delayed
sample-008003,fatima is a woman of the desert said the alchemist
sample-008004,i want you to help me turn myself into the wind the boy answered
sample-008005,not even the tribal chieftains are able to see him when they want to
sample-008006,yet it was a little too large for assurance
sample-008007,i'm afraid she'd feel ashamed to think she hadn't trusted you
sample-008008,i've already had that experience with my sheep and now it's happening with people
sample-008009,you had me worried
sample-008010,a whiskey is the perfect end to my day
sample-008011,i wished i had a light to smoke by
sample-008012,there was no trace of him
sample-008013,i have the money i need to buy my sheep
sample-008014,we couldn't find the high street
sample-008015,just by looking at them
sample-008016,something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top
sample-008017,but they were not there
sample-008018,just handling them made him feel better
sample-008019,most people there take it out pretty early in life
sample-008020,first i gotta tell her what news to get
sample-008021,i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit
sample-008022,but what's all this
sample-008023,when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
sample-008024,the woman was silent for some time
sample-008025,the tradition teaches men how to cross the desert and how their children should marry
sample-008026,they also began to feel that they knew a better way than others had
sample-008027,an alchemist said the alchemist
sample-008028,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
sample-008029,but i found it difficult to get to work because of the investigations
sample-008030,the end of the cylinder was still as ogilvy and henderson had left it
sample-008031,you don't have to smell the world
sample-008032,it almost retained its shape
sample-008033,but you are in the desert
sample-008034,how did you learn to read the girl asked at one point
sample-008035,this desert was once a sea he said
sample-008036,it was the time of day when all of spain slept during the summer
sample-008037,all this happened between sunrise and sunset the boy thought
sample-008038,his hands were abraded and exhausted but he listened to his heart
sample-008039,you want a drink or don't you
sample-008040,because they're still here
sample-008041,he was selling better than ever
sample-008042,the guy thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to stop him
sample-008043,the whole town's gone crazy
sample-008044,been seeing me in your dreams
sample-008045,the table was adorned with lavish decorations
sample-008046,as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
sample-008047,the men of the desert were already familiar with that wind
sample-008050,you'll use your knowledge for the welfare of the oasis and its inhabitants
sample-008051,she may be lost
sample-008052,haven't you got any feeling
sample-008053,some storms are worth the wreckage
sample-008054,without such love one's dreams would have no meaning
sample-008055,how do you think i got here
sample-008056,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
sample-008057,i'm trying to explain to my mother how to get pictures off her phone
sample-008068,treason is a blow that comes unexpectedly
sample-008069,this investment won't pay off
sample-008078,what's the matter with eleanor
sample-008079,you came so that you could learn about your dreams said the old woman
sample-008080,they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
sample-008081,she probably worked it out in advance
sample-008082,earlier this year we found a really nice place near my office and we moved in together
sample-008083,that's true enough the boy thought ruefully
sample-008084,he walked slowly through the market
sample-008085,stop treating me like a child
sample-008086,the daffodils are blooming
sample-008087,they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
sample-008090,there was a moment of silence so profound that it seemed the city was asleep
sample-008091,golden penguins are so last season
sample-008092,he told fatima that at their next meeting
sample-008093,in those days very few of the people had any idea about astronomy
sample-008094,the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees
sample-008095,you will never be able to escape from your heart
sample-008096,his heart was heavy and he had been melancholy since the previous night
sample-008097,you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
sample-008108,do you know what's wrong with you
sample-008109,you will never be able to escape from your heart
sample-008118,and finally the falcon returned with their meal
sample-008119,what's he doing here
sample-008120,i noticed that the boy answered
sample-008121,in alchemy it's called the soul of the world
sample-008122,they have their eyes glued on his face
sample-008123,they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
sample-008124,how do people celebrate good weather over there
sample-008125,my friend said i love you
sample-008126,and he wasn't faring much better
sample-008127,but i found it difficult to get to work because of the investigations
sample-008130,his heart was heavy and he had been melancholy since the previous night
sample-008131,are there any other questions
sample-008132,well then why do we need all these books the boy asked
sample-008133,during the third year the omens will continue to speak of your treasure and your destiny
sample-008134,when you play cards the first time you are almost sure to win
sample-008135,he could always become a crystal salesman again
sample-008136,at that point the omens will tell you that your treasure is buried forever
sample-008137,you are wise because you observe everything from a distance the boy said
sample-008140,so you won't blame her
sample-008141,i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
sample-008142,the stranger withdrew the sword from the boy's forehead and the boy felt immensely relieved
sample-008143,the boy reminded the old man that he had said something about hidden treasure
sample-008144,finally a young woman approached who was not dressed in black
sample-008145,two days ago you said that i had never dreamed of travel the merchant answered
sample-008146,the desert didn't answer him for a few moments
sample-008147,i don't care whether she did or not
sample-008148,that was the law of hospitality
sample-008149,as soon as he saw me among the crowd he called to me to come down
sample-008150,this is the morning post you're talking to
sample-008151,there's no time like the present
sample-008152,i thought you were going to teach me some of the things you know
sample-008153,it was glaringly hot not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind
sample-008154,and one or two persons were returning
sample-008155,i failed to reach a conclusive interpretation
sample-008156,just the way yours do when you're happy
sample-008157,ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
sample-008158,can i get a woot woot
sample-008159,i'm never more aware of a room's acoustics than when i'm trying to enjoy a snack i have no intention of sharing
sample-008160,well then help me do that the boy said
sample-008161,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
sample-008162,the boy picked up his pouch and put it with his other things
sample-008164,and maybe it wasn't that they were teaching me but that i was learning from them
sample-008165,my mind ran on the possibilities of its content
sample-008166,the boy was startled
sample-008167,you have enough gold to buy many sheep and many camels
sample-008168,first they tried to find him on their own
sample-008169,ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
sample-008170,of course you never did
sample-008171,but that was simply because my eye was tired
sample-008172,do you want to wake that baby
sample-008173,i wouldn't want to use that tub
sample-008174,i want to leave this with you
sample-008175,it didn't even occur to the boy to flee
sample-008176,come into my office
sample-008178,he spent the entire morning observing the infrequent comings and goings in the street
sample-008179,now what are you going to do
sample-008180,he had come to the town only to find a woman who could interpret his dream
sample-008181,what have you got to report
sample-008182,since the miner had sacrificed everything to his destiny the old man decided to become involved
sample-008183,he began to dig at the base of the sycamore
sample-008184,go to this address
sample-008185,why don't you fellows get your own news
sample-008186,the police probably think i killed him
sample-008187,it's not often that money can save someone's life
sample-008189,somebody would have seen it
sample-008190,they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
sample-008191,the boy looked around for the ovens and other apparatus used in alchemy but saw none
sample-008192,something happens here you'll have to remember later on
sample-008193,down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
sample-008194,everyone seemed very excited
sample-008195,you told me that
sample-008196,if you start your emails with greetings let me be the first to welcome you to earth
sample-008197,the thought was so dreadful to him that he forgot about the heat and went forward
sample-008198,how do people celebrate good weather over there
sample-008199,the next day the boy met the old man at noon
sample-008200,love is the force that transforms and improves the soul of the world
sample-008201,you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
sample-008202,the vertex was out of alignment
sample-008203,i heard what you were talking about the other day with the alchemist the wind said
sample-008204,i think we can do better after the boat sails
sample-008205,wouldn't it be nice if we were like that
sample-008206,when he's an old man he's going to spend a month in africa
sample-008207,they were his treasure
sample-008208,the guy thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to stop him
sample-008209,look what the chronicle is running on laura ben
sample-008210,i just don't trust anyone who says they've never had hamburger helper
sample-008211,i shall make us some ice cubes
sample-008212,scattered groups of people were hurrying from the direction of woking
sample-008213,you didn't have to do any cleaning he said
sample-008214,that night there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet
sample-008215,i thought sure you'd remember me
sample-008216,the level ground was blackened as far as one could see and it was still giving off smoke
sample-008217,the computer artist waited for the latest image to render
sample-008218,i pointed out mars a bright dot of light
sample-008219,the old man knew how to read and had already read the book
sample-008220,the thought was so dreadful to him that he forgot about the heat and went forward
sample-008221,life attracts life the alchemist answered
sample-008222,we dont want him
sample-008223,the congestion was heavy throughout the city
sample-008224,you haven't seen anything yet
sample-008225,you said it to me too
sample-008226,but the merchant understood what the boy had said
sample-008227,and at that i told him and he took my place
sample-008228,he stood irresolute for a moment and then scrambled out of the pit
sample-008229,and your camels will bring you wealth and power
sample-008230,edinburgh is a dreamlike place to visit
sample-008231,you couldn't get a bigger bed in here though
sample-008232,it sounded as if you said no charge
sample-008233,they crossed the desert for another two days in silence
sample-008234,this box of markers has many different colors
sample-008235,do you know what i mean
sample-008236,it was the pure language of the world
sample-008237,she needs to get her transcripts and passport first
sample-008238,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
sample-008239,most of them were staring quietly at the big table
sample-008240,the birthday party was a surprise
sample-008241,some went away while i was there and other people came
sample-008242,it was a bundle of money
sample-008243,i saw a young man standing on the cylinder and trying to scramble out of the hole again
sample-008244,but he kept the sword in his hand
sample-008245,the boy watched the exchange with fascination
sample-008246,from where he sat he could observe the plaza
sample-008247,but one of them seized the boy and yanked him back out of the hole
sample-008250,only when he himself reveals it
sample-008251,i myself heard nothing of that
sample-008252,are you sure they are not all there
sample-008253,she'll see us through dinner
sample-008254,he had assumed he would soon return to his sheep
sample-008255,glad he took the t out of that
sample-008256,it turned out to be a bitter tea
sample-008257,he had assumed he would soon return to his sheep
sample-008268,i have no information about troops or about the movement of the tribes
sample-008269,as soon as he saw me among the crowd he called to me to come down
sample-008278,pedestrians were standing on a sidewalk paved with cobblestone
sample-008279,a shepherd may like to travel but he should never forget about his sheep
sample-008280,for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
sample-008281,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
sample-008282,and the names of the people involved were very difficult to pronounce
sample-008283,even then he hardly understood what this meant
sample-008284,the englishman was unable to sleep one night
sample-008285,he thought that with some patience he'd be able to transform everything into gold
sample-008286,this lets me launch gui emacs to write code and edit my macro files which have to live on windows
sample-008287,so how will we name all these hurricanes
sample-008290,mecca is a lot farther away than the pyramids
sample-008291,watching the parody was great entertainment
sample-008292,and maybe it wasn't that they were teaching me but that i was learning from them
sample-008293,lots of shepherds passed through selling their wool
sample-008294,he took out one of the stones
sample-008295,it seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of here
sample-008296,i guess i used all the shells
sample-008297,there was a murmur from the crowd
sample-008308,you'll get into a worse one if you don't
sample-008309,in a way so am i he said
sample-008318,thank you said the boy
sample-008319,it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-008320,no he heard a voice on the wind say
sample-008321,it seemed so safe and tranquil
sample-008322,it's not i the wind spoke about
sample-008323,the old man knew how to read and had already read the book
sample-008324,where'd you get this
sample-008325,i'll go further than that
sample-008326,neighbors moved away and there remained only a few small shops on the hill
sample-008327,looking down at the spoon he held the boy saw that the oil was gone
sample-008330,i myself heard nothing of that
sample-008331,maybe that's why they give up on it so early too
sample-008332,how about driving me home in style
sample-008333,others stumbled upon the stone by accident
sample-008334,exactly answered the alchemist
sample-008335,he recited an our father silently
sample-008336,i'll get it for you
sample-008337,many telescopes were pointed at it
sample-008340,the boy listened quietly
sample-008341,it means my job
sample-008342,that day the merchant gave the boy permission to build the display
sample-008343,that's a christmas present from a very dear friend of mine
sample-008344,the heather was on fire and you could see a thin blue smoke rising up slowly
sample-008345,but the boy couldn't even speak
sample-008346,he didn't consider mending the hole  the stones could fall through any time they wanted
sample-008347,the boy had met the alchemist
sample-008348,and because the tribes declared war i went to the well seeking the alchemist
sample-008349,because you will never again be able to keep it quiet
sample-008350,please use your turn signal
sample-008351,i thought you were gone
sample-008352,sometimes i get so mad at you i can't see straight
sample-008353,earlier this year we found a really nice place near my office and we moved in together
sample-008354,from then on he would make his own decisions
sample-008355,the years of research the magic symbols the strange words and the laboratory equipment
sample-008356,what difference does that make
sample-008357,i'm going to them
sample-008358,he should respect tradition
sample-008359,wouldn't do any good
sample-008360,the merchant looked anxiously at the boy
sample-008361,the caravan moved toward the east
sample-008362,who do you think writes them
sample-008363,you would have to have been born an arab to understand he answered
sample-008364,laura took out a cigarette and placed it in her mouth
sample-008365,didn't you read it
sample-008366,as soon as he saw me among the crowd he called to me to come down
sample-008367,ogilvy watched till one and then gave up
sample-008368,the line forms on the right
sample-008369,back into the excavation
sample-008370,even when all you want to do is travel
sample-008371,hires two personal trainers and make one of them train the other one
sample-008372,pedestrians were standing on a sidewalk paved with cobblestone
sample-008373,the boy trusted his new friend
sample-008374,you have no identity
sample-008375,starting with his own
sample-008376,every purchase is a vote
sample-008377,not even the tribal chieftains are able to see him when they want to
sample-008378,and he vanished around the corner of the plaza
sample-008379,ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
sample-008380,i had never heard of alchemists before the boy said
sample-008381,the stranger was speaking of things that very few people knew about
sample-008382,i want to stay at the oasis the boy answered
sample-008383,but you know that i'm not going to go to mecca
sample-008384,get a load of this
sample-008385,we heard a lot of yelling
sample-008386,had our instruments permitted it we might have been able to see the trouble way back when
sample-008387,he experienced the pictures with his fingers while he listened
sample-008388,he understands the forces of nature
sample-008389,something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top
sample-008390,because he knew what he would find
sample-008391,they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
sample-008392,she says it's nothing to worry about
sample-008393,i can explain if you'll just listen
sample-008394,the carpet was exquisite
sample-008395,so then try he said to the englishman
sample-008396,it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience
sample-008397,i guess you must think i'm kinda batty
sample-008398,you were seen at the enemy camp three days ago
sample-008399,don't say that again
sample-008400,the boy recalled the brilliance he had noticed on the previous day
sample-008401,not to worry said the alchemist
sample-008402,the heather was on fire and you could see a thin blue smoke rising up slowly
sample-008403,don't ask me how i know
sample-008404,steven touched himself on the back of his neck
sample-008405,stick to your clubs
sample-008406,as the sun rose the men began to beat the boy
sample-008407,i am definitely open to the idea because ive always wanted to work as a small business owner
sample-008408,harry'll tear his dinner suit
sample-008409,it spread through the planet's atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features
sample-008410,he had come to the town only to find a woman who could interpret his dream
sample-008411,your website domain is now a public resource
sample-008412,the treasure is at the pyramids that you already knew
sample-008413,then suddenly he noticed it with a start
sample-008414,that makes sense the alchemist answered
sample-008415,as secretary you can hire anyone you like
sample-008416,i'm going to find that damned alchemist the englishman thought
sample-008417,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
sample-008418,they were on the right track
sample-008419,it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
sample-008420,one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
sample-008421,he spent the entire morning observing the infrequent comings and goings in the street
sample-008422,sometimes i get so mad at you i can't see straight
sample-008423,well usually i learn more from my sheep than from books he answered
sample-008424,if a person is living out his destiny he knows everything he needs to know
sample-008425,she will go down in history as the greatest brain surgeon in the world
sample-008426,he was learning a lot of new things
sample-008427,we lit the lantern and walked over to his house
sample-008428,this is for the boy
sample-008429,tomorrow morning at ten o'clock
sample-008430,the war is going to end someday the girl said
sample-008431,never mind those guys
sample-008432,then taking his sheep he walked away
sample-008433,i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
sample-008434,if i only could call my mom
sample-008435,its important that everyone especially little guys can participate in the future of the internet
sample-008436,the old man leafed through the book and fell to reading a page he came to
sample-008437,it was about you
sample-008438,it said that the darkest hour of the night came just before the dawn
sample-008439,even me  i haven't thought of other women since i met the merchant's daughter
sample-008440,the man wept with happiness
sample-008441,it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-008442,and it's not love to see everything from a distance like you do
sample-008443,but that was simply because my eye was tired
sample-008444,the two men hurried back and found the cylinder still lying in the same position
sample-008445,who do you want
sample-008446,wait till martha hears about this
sample-008447,they wanted to save the oasis
sample-008450,i've done nothing of the sort
sample-008451,i never saw amanda act like that before
sample-008452,i ain't seen him for a week
sample-008453,this is for the boy
sample-008454,should i understand the emerald tablet the boy asked
sample-008455,we were all made by the same hand and we have the same soul
sample-008456,what a lovely day
sample-008457,he wandered for a while keeping the date palms of the oasis within sight
sample-008468,two days later the merchant spoke to the boy about the display
sample-008469,volleyball is almost equally popular in both genders
sample-008478,the area was swirling in dust so intense that it hid the moon from view
sample-008479,too young or too old
sample-008480,i promised that i would make my own decisions he said to himself
sample-008481,it seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of here
sample-008482,lindsey promised to call you from new york tonight
sample-008483,so you combined pleasure with business
sample-008484,are you crazy the boy asked the alchemist when they had moved on
sample-008485,a good example of a dinosaur is the pterodactyl
sample-008486,that's a good luck omen the englishman said after the fat arab had gone out
sample-008487,bush leagues mostly
sample-008490,the boy put the stones in his pouch
sample-008491,when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
sample-008492,when he was a child that man wanted to travel too
sample-008493,i can clean up those glasses in the window if you want said the boy
sample-008494,but they were not there
sample-008495,i have to admit that my horizon has expanded exponentially
sample-008496,so that those who have the responsibility for understanding can understand he said
sample-008497,the woman sat down and told him to be seated as well
sample-008508,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
sample-008509,that sobered him a little
sample-008518,wait for the signal
sample-008519,i had that right here
sample-008520,henderson stood up with a spade in his hand
sample-008521,i'm not doing it for you
sample-008522,they opened the bottle of wine and drank heavily
sample-008523,these cookies are delicious
sample-008524,the boy looked around for the ovens and other apparatus used in alchemy but saw none
sample-008525,the streamer of gas came out towards us
sample-008526,he spent the entire morning observing the infrequent comings and goings in the street
sample-008527,i got it all ready
sample-008530,my mind ran on the possibilities of its content
sample-008531,and finally the falcon returned with their meal
sample-008532,it must have fallen while i was sitting over there
sample-008533,but i didnt think that it contained any living creature
sample-008534,katie screamed that they were going to lose
sample-008535,thank you said the boy
sample-008536,just for the first year
sample-008537,that's what i did before i married charles
sample-008540,i can see april coming
sample-008541,you're going to run into the governor
sample-008542,well then why do we need all these books the boy asked
sample-008543,and at that i told him and he took my place
sample-008544,it was aligned perfectly
sample-008545,scattered groups of people were hurrying from the direction of woking
sample-008546,did you learn anything the englishman asked eager to hear what it might be
sample-008547,the comparison to other works on different databases is still problematic
sample-008548,that's what makes it romantic
sample-008549,you said you wanted fireworks
sample-008550,i've already mailed a copy of this letter to mrs louise
sample-008551,you must love the desert but never trust it completely
sample-008552,its lower end was still embedded
sample-008553,don't do it for me
sample-008554,liz put the flowers into a mirrored vase
sample-008555,the alchemist stopped abruptly and bent to the ground
sample-008556,they're calling to us not to give up and to keep on fighting
sample-008557,the night was warm and i was thirsty
sample-008558,the trouble with you is you let people step on you
sample-008559,they all say they wrote the letter
sample-008560,camels are traitorous they walk thousands of paces and never seem to tire
sample-008561,they were fascinating stories each of them lived out his destiny to the end
sample-008562,he also tried to remember some good stories to relate as he sheared the sheep
sample-008563,i think i sprained my pride
sample-008564,but the crystal merchant had no choice
sample-008565,well why don't we go there right now the boy asked
sample-008566,now leave us alone said the boy to the young arab
sample-008567,but now the sounds inside had stopped
sample-008568,you have enough gold to buy many sheep and many camels
sample-008569,then taking his sheep he walked away
sample-008570,that's true enough the boy thought ruefully
sample-008571,then he dropped his spade picked up his jacket and came out into the road
sample-008572,especially with an election coming up in a few days
sample-008573,then came the night of the first falling star
sample-008574,i'm going away he said
sample-008575,with every day that passed the boy's heart became more and more silent
sample-008576,his hands were abraded and exhausted but he listened to his heart
sample-008577,for dinner they had cesar salad
sample-008578,when she saw the unknown object bobbing up and down the edge she was absolutely horrified
sample-008579,and seizing the boy's bag the alchemist gave the gold coins to the chief
sample-008580,i need ten dollars
sample-008581,you wanna take this outside
sample-008582,do you know what cia stands for
sample-008583,your son went to serve at a distant place and became a centurion
sample-008584,the stranger continued to hold the sword at the boy's forehead
sample-008585,i was impatient to see it opened
sample-008586,why don't you have your friends join us
sample-008587,you are wise because you observe everything from a distance the boy said
sample-008588,i want my baby to look like you
sample-008589,we always observe the tradition
sample-008590,to be fully funded some lending must occur
sample-008591,the genies were the spirits of good and evil
sample-008592,but don't take my word for it
sample-008593,in this paragraph i want to underline the severity of the refinery event
sample-008594,i'm not easier to live with than he was
sample-008595,that's the best part of it
sample-008596,they were people of the desert and clamored to hear his stories about the great cities
sample-008597,the soul of the world is nourished by people's happiness
sample-008598,a large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered
sample-008599,shall i pray for him
sample-008600,he didn't mind the extra work
sample-008601,hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after
sample-008602,i'm looking for a treasure said the boy and he immediately regretted having said it
sample-008603,i need some time to think
sample-008604,can i help you asked the man behind the window
sample-008606,it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-008607,my name's heather
sample-008608,patrick has terminal cancer
sample-008609,running was futile because they were so small
sample-008610,strange images passed through my mind
sample-008612,he should have decided to become a shepherd the boy said
sample-008613,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
sample-008614,my tax dollars pay for those public school proms
sample-008615,the englishman's eyes lit up
sample-008616,nobody ever changes around here
sample-008617,worryingly the radio signal became weaker
sample-008618,the omens had been true after all
sample-008619,and finally the falcon returned with their meal
sample-008620,they were known as seers and they were held in fear by women and the elderly
sample-008621,the horizon was tinged with red and suddenly the sun appeared
sample-008622,it was just ripe enough to eat
sample-008623,the clock of the town center took damage from a lightening strike
sample-008624,all i saw was an army said the boy
sample-008625,i only interpret dreams
sample-008626,everything's getting cold and you know we've been waiting for you
sample-008627,a registration process is required
sample-008628,the boy spent a sleepless night
sample-008629,if you pay attention to the present you can improve upon it
sample-008630,a hundred nuns stampeded the vatican
sample-008631,what did you come here for
sample-008632,no one seemed to have thought about it that night
sample-008633,and one or two persons were returning
sample-008634,one afternoon one of his servants fell ill and it appeared that he would die
sample-008635,will you help me
sample-008636,the englishman prodded him and the boy asked her about the man who cured people's illnesses
sample-008637,my mind ran on the possibilities of its content
sample-008638,wait till we get home
sample-008640,what have you got to report
sample-008641,ogilvy watched till one and then gave up
sample-008642,bacon pancakes and maple syrup is a hearty start to any day
sample-008643,i'm going to them
sample-008644,but if you can try to make your own decisions
sample-008645,he wanted to tell him about fatima
sample-008646,so how will we name all these hurricanes
sample-008647,i can't think any more
sample-008650,the solar eclipse cast us all in shadow
sample-008651,it was the old man who spoke first
sample-008652,and at that i told him and he took my place
sample-008653,think i'll go home and see what the family is doing
sample-008654,no the alchemist answered
sample-008655,then who's this one
sample-008656,your dentist called yesterday
sample-008657,they blow across the world without a birthplace and with no place to die
sample-008668,the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
sample-008669,meanwhile the old man persisted in his attempt to strike up a conversation
sample-008678,you can hear out of it
sample-008679,somebody's driving this cab
sample-008680,he was tense and upset because he knew that the old man was right
sample-008681,it's not easy to find the philosopher's stone said the englishman
sample-008682,well what good would it be to you if you had t die the alchemist answered
sample-008683,my review of the sun one star
sample-008684,writing sentences that will be read by hundreds of people makes me feel so powerful
sample-008685,then taking his sheep he walked away
sample-008686,i've already told you
sample-008687,i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
sample-008690,he wanted to say so to the alchemist but he was afraid of the man
sample-008691,get out of here
sample-008692,you old sorcerer the boy shouted up to the sky
sample-008693,but those who know about such things would know that those are urim and thummim
sample-008694,i don't like coconuts
sample-008695,he sat on a stone and allowed himself to become hypnotized by the horizon
sample-008696,it brought his heart into his mouth
sample-008697,i'm going to become bitter and distrustful of people because one person betrayed me
sample-008708,don't give in to your fears said the alchemist in a strangely gentle voice
sample-008709,for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
sample-008718,suddenly he disappeared and i could hear a faint shriek behind the walls
sample-008719,i won't leave you
sample-008720,now his intuition was that he had been right in coming
sample-008721,the sun thought about that and decided to shine more brightly
sample-008722,you couldn't even be honest about being dishonest
sample-008723,i'm gonna build air fields
sample-008724,he had surprised himself with the thought
sample-008725,i'll work for you he said
sample-008726,and for wise men gold is the metal that evolved the furthest
sample-008727,what kind of blow should one deliver next in order to remain alive
sample-008730,others stumbled upon the stone by accident
sample-008731,everyone when they are young knows what their destiny is
sample-008732,many people in berkshire surrey and middlesex must have seen it
sample-008733,he listened to the wind and felt the stones beneath his feet
sample-008734,you been in a fight
sample-008735,a boy came running towards me
sample-008736,the boy was also saddened his friend was in pursuit of his destiny
sample-008737,to stuff into their own pockets
sample-008740,i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
sample-008741,please don't make me
sample-008742,because i don't live in either my past or my future
sample-008743,the man who bought them last week was american
sample-008744,air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
sample-008745,then the thing came upon him in a flash
sample-008746,no baselines or comparison to state of the art is provided
sample-008747,the publicity's the main thing
sample-008748,can you remember anything at all
sample-008749,and the odor of the animals became a bit more tolerable
sample-008750,the old man wore a breastplate of heavy gold covered with precious stones
sample-008751,it doesnt count as screen time if it is a game
sample-008752,scattered groups of people were hurrying from the direction of woking
sample-008753,i don't want anything for myself
sample-008754,fortunately for us our sun will continue to be around for a few billion years
sample-008755,who do you think writes them
sample-008756,many people think computers will never have feelings
sample-008757,somebody would have seen it
sample-008758,the merchant looked anxiously at the boy
sample-008759,when you are in love things make even more sense he thought
sample-008760,then how do i know this is your office
sample-008761,a shepherd may like to travel but he should never forget about his sheep
sample-008762,what are you doing up here then
sample-008763,it's just exactly what i wanted
sample-008764,so how will we name all these hurricanes
sample-008765,you can't offer me something that is already mine the chief said arrogantly
sample-008766,the clock was slightly askew
sample-008767,he looked around at the empty plaza again feeling less desperate than before
sample-008768,the alchemist followed as the boy's horse ran for almost half an hour
sample-008769,it was the most delicious wine he had ever tasted
sample-008770,there was very little talking
sample-008771,all they think about is food and water
sample-008772,it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
sample-008773,they shouted consolation and promises and went off back to the town again to get help
sample-008774,i have the diet of a kid who found twenty dollars
sample-008775,don't let them see that you're afraid the alchemist said
sample-008776,they don't see that the fields are new and the seasons change
sample-008777,it helped me to trust in people the englishman answered
sample-008778,it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
sample-008779,i had seen all that it would presently bring me
sample-008780,there are many languages spoken by things the boy said
sample-008781,her hair flowed down her back
sample-008782,something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top
sample-008783,hunches his mother used to call them
sample-008784,go down to the office and arrange for some radio time
sample-008785,gold would lose its value
sample-008786,i just happened to be passing by
sample-008787,he reached over and picked up a shell from the ground
sample-008788,we need to solve this problem fast
sample-008789,at the first glance it was really not very exciting
sample-008790,who would have thought that
sample-008791,but you will love her and she'll return your love
sample-008792,my seven year resume gap is marked not drugs
sample-008793,can i help you asked the man behind the window
sample-008794,thanks to reverse port tunneling i can expose this http server running on windows to my linux machine
sample-008795,something's the matter with the baby
sample-008796,he's followed every game and his mouth's watering
sample-008797,maybe this is an omen said the englishman half aloud
sample-008798,they went to the kitchen at the back of the monastery
sample-008799,as he was attempting to pull out the rocks he encountered he heard footsteps
sample-008800,this is for you
sample-008801,but don't worry the alchemist continued
sample-008802,but he didn't stop
sample-008803,a friend of yours
sample-008804,and eventually man will nourish your sands where the game will once again flourish
sample-008805,the englishman was disappointed
sample-008806,something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top
sample-008807,the boy stepped closer to the girl and when she smiled he did the same
sample-008808,a boy came running towards me
sample-008809,you're worth your weight in gold
sample-008810,is the head better
sample-008811,a large piece suddenly came off and fell with a loud and sharp noise
sample-008812,he put a sign on the door and they went to a small cafe nearby
sample-008813,i would have won the junior olympics if not for those medaling kids
sample-008814,the plastic barrier shattered
sample-008815,the insurgents gathered sticks and wood
sample-008816,maybe we'd better ask someone the boy suggested
sample-008817,the war is going to end someday the girl said
sample-008818,they provided warnings about thieves and barbarian tribes
sample-008819,this desert was once a sea he said
sample-008820,my wacom tablet has a dodgy wire
sample-008821,fill this place with a sandstorm so strong that it blots out the sun
sample-008822,i've just guaranteed the bank sufficient funds to meet their needs
sample-008823,where was his horse
sample-008824,you sure nothing's missing
sample-008825,i was scared but wasted no time in going out and crossing the bridge to the sand pits
sample-008826,a large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered
sample-008827,it is i who dared to do so said the boy
sample-008828,it would be very useful if my web browser could synchronize all of its preferences not just some
sample-008829,it was my fear of failure that first kept me from attempting the master work
sample-008830,he was more confident in himself though and felt as though he could conquer the world
sample-008831,because my eyes are not yet accustomed to the desert the boy said
sample-008832,with the wars between the tribes it's impossible to cross the desert
sample-008833,and he gave the boy his blessing
sample-008834,the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
sample-008835,what did you do with her
sample-008837,it would have been visible to me had i only looked up as it passed
sample-008838,but that's what you're doing
sample-008839,he saw the boy appear from the other side of the dunes
sample-008848,the night was warm and i was thirsty
sample-008849,and they found the watch on him
sample-008858,the burning fire had been extinguished
sample-008859,be careful with your prognostications said the stranger
sample-008860,hires two personal trainers and make one of them train the other one
sample-008861,i'll tell you something more
sample-008862,he stuck his hand into the pouch and felt around for one of the stones
sample-008863,but just before lunchtime a boy stopped in front of the shop
sample-008864,the camel driver understood what the boy was saying
sample-008865,its lower end was still embedded
sample-008866,after writing a bug report one should regularly check if someone responded
sample-008867,is it all right
sample-008870,looking through the telescope i saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet
sample-008871,now i will drift gently off to dreamland
sample-008872,i can't find it anywhere
sample-008873,a line of flame high can be seen in the atmosphere
sample-008874,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
sample-008875,there's life here the boy said to the alchemist
sample-008876,do you know what cia stands for
sample-008877,didn't i tell you never to come panhandling around here
sample-008888,the animals were exhausted and the men talked among themselves less and less
sample-008889,i've really started to appreciate imperial measurements you could say i'm a convert
sample-008898,all i saw was an army said the boy
sample-008899,i'm doing much better and soon you'll be able to return to your sheep
sample-008900,the end of the cylinder was still as ogilvy and henderson had left it
sample-008901,who's down there with you
sample-008902,i think i will
sample-008903,maybe we'd better ask someone the boy suggested
sample-008904,her life is a series of plot twists
sample-008905,he decided to spend the night there
sample-008906,a partnership in the strictest sense of the word
sample-008907,its lower end was still embedded
sample-008910,i had a memo from art today
sample-008911,he had found where his treasure was and was frightened at what might happen
sample-008912,i do want that platinum ring
sample-008913,that's the principle that governs all things he said
sample-008914,night after night holly came back late from the office
sample-008915,it was the old man who spoke first
sample-008916,i have disabled some of the certificate authorities but they're not grayed out in this list
sample-008917,it seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of here
sample-008928,there were really i think two or three hundred people elbowing one another
sample-008929,everyone seemed very excited
sample-008938,that's why i'm quitting
sample-008939,the boy smiled to himself
sample-008940,the boy remembered an old proverb from his country
sample-008941,the buttons made a strange clicking sound when pressed
sample-008942,he was already re accustomed to desert's silence
sample-008943,the boy promised himself that when he returned from egypt he would buy that sword
sample-008944,can you get in this desk
sample-008945,the people will enjoy the tea and want to buy the glasses
sample-008946,but he didn't stop
sample-008947,i dont mind working from home most of the time but i do miss having coworkers
sample-008948,we're refugees from the tribal wars and we need money the other figure said
sample-008949,a large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered
sample-008950,all that time the martians must have been getting ready
sample-008951,i'm just a man who wanders the desert and knows the stars said the alchemist
sample-008952,he carried two dead hawks over his shoulder
sample-008953,bitcoin mining can be done with graphic cards or with specialized hardware
sample-008954,i use templates in my text editor to quickly generate boilerplate syntax such as the skeleton of a for loop
sample-008955,i hold the power of life and death for every person i take with me
sample-008956,this biscuit is yummy
sample-008957,that's why i want you to continue toward your goal
sample-008958,then you taught me something of the universal language and the soul of the world
sample-008959,the caravan would be very lucky to reach the oasis
sample-008960,there is not even the possibility of doing that
sample-008961,two physicists pondered their revised quantum field theory together
sample-008962,when you are in love things make even more sense he thought
sample-008963,they voted carlos down
sample-008964,it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
sample-008965,never mind those guys
sample-008966,what had been next to him five minutes ago was now at the other side
sample-008967,you hit my best friend
sample-008968,we know what you're up to
sample-008969,he believed in omens
sample-008970,when did you get back
sample-008971,sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
sample-008972,i can't let her out
sample-008973,but the crystal merchant had no choice
sample-008974,go and speak to the tribal chieftains said the camel driver
sample-008975,but he didn't need to worry about that right now
sample-008976,your son went to serve at a distant place and became a centurion
sample-008977,he noticed the unequal cooling of its surface
sample-008978,they were his treasure
sample-008979,our merchants bought that man and brought him to egypt
sample-008980,i'm leaving today said the boy
sample-008981,the boy was surprised and then irritated
sample-008982,there's something funny going on around here
sample-008983,much better said the old man
sample-008984,i'm just a fool
sample-008985,the vertex was out of alignment
sample-008986,life attracts life the alchemist answered
sample-008987,the serpent relaxed immediately
sample-008988,please don't cry
sample-008989,just like an organ
sample-008990,about eleven i walked back to my home in maybury because nothing seemed to be happening
sample-008991,three days from now he would be with the merchant's daughter
sample-008992,so we their hearts speak more and more softly
sample-008993,the one you marry has got to swim rivers for you
sample-008994,they set off running wildly into the trees
sample-008995,on the very first page it described a burial ceremony
sample-008996,for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
sample-008997,even when all you want to do is travel
sample-008998,did you ever walk into this office
sample-008999,but he takes advantage of you
sample-009000,i'm afraid you're blocking my view
sample-009001,give them a little third degree
sample-009002,much better said the old man
sample-009003,tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself
sample-009004,but i'd like to see the castles in the towns where they live the boy explained
sample-009005,a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder
sample-009006,i'm not good enough to make this one up
sample-009007,i shall make us some ice cubes
sample-009010,you already know all you need to know
sample-009011,at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars
sample-009012,might just as well be
sample-009013,i was impatient to see it opened
sample-009014,they represent millions of voters
sample-009015,and you ought to read more about the world answered the englishman
sample-009016,the night was warm and i was thirsty
sample-009017,melissa's phone kept vibrating uncontrollably
sample-009028,down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
sample-009029,it was the old man who spoke first
sample-009038,i wonder what's keeping mother
sample-009039,the boy stepped closer to the girl and when she smiled he did the same
sample-009040,i was torn between fear and curiosity
sample-009041,what is a foreigner doing here asked another of the men
sample-009042,i'll let you know as soon as i have something
sample-009043,the boy noticed that the owner of the bar stood nearby listening attentively to their conversation
sample-009044,what are you talking about
sample-009045,the boy awoke as the sun rose
sample-009046,i wanted to sleep a little longer he thought
sample-009047,i wish you'd let me help you
sample-009048,what does that get us
sample-009049,i've been to your house a hundred times
sample-009050,how do you think i got here
sample-009051,the briefing room was abandoned
sample-009052,the criminals taunted the police officers and prison guards
sample-009053,carol saved her brother's life that day
sample-009054,they went out of business years ago
sample-009055,that sobered him a little
sample-009056,only when he consents
sample-009057,and then he perceived it very slowly
sample-009058,the wind told me that you know about love the boy said to the sun
sample-009059,he'll be ready on time
sample-009060,the miner had abandoned everything to go mining for emeralds
sample-009061,wait till we get home
sample-009062,that doesn't happen to just anyone
sample-009063,he has other things to do first
sample-009064,the boy was shocked
sample-009065,he had been to the village only once the year before
sample-009066,i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
sample-009067,must she keep playing that
sample-009068,why a revolver he asked
sample-009069,who's this gal she's gonna marry
sample-009070,it doesn't matter he said to his sheep
sample-009071,fatima was more important than his treasure
sample-009072,i wish they were too
sample-009073,they are so used to me that they know my schedule he muttered
sample-009074,when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
sample-009075,we lit the lantern and walked over to his house
sample-009076,i know that girl
sample-009077,i never knew grandma to be so determined before
sample-009078,the boy trusted his new friend
sample-009079,they're not concerned with that right now
sample-009080,the desert with its endless monotony put him to dreaming
sample-009081,the boy promised himself that when he returned from egypt he would buy that sword
sample-009082,mrs ruth victor wants to see you
sample-009083,he had been so far away that his face wasn't even visible
sample-009084,i don't know you from adam
sample-009085,the two men hurried back and found the cylinder still lying in the same position
sample-009086,all they think about is food and water
sample-009087,they were tribesmen dressed in blue with black rings surrounding their turbans
sample-009088,now who'da done a mean thing like that
sample-009089,there is a universal language understood by everybody but already forgotten
sample-009090,are you going to go to julia's
sample-009091,two horsemen waiting ahead of them
sample-009092,canada is quite cold at times
sample-009093,ten minutes for what
sample-009094,i'm going to them
sample-009095,you've got to do something
sample-009096,they set off running wildly into the trees
sample-009097,he got up adjusted his clothing and picked up his pouch
sample-009098,when i returned to the common the sun was setting
sample-009099,there were mountains in the distance
sample-009100,there is no wine in this country the young man said
sample-009101,you and i aren't like hassan that rich merchant
sample-009102,i saw a young man standing on the cylinder and trying to scramble out of the hole again
sample-009103,he won't leave the circle
sample-009104,a line of flame high can be seen in the atmosphere
sample-009105,a boy came running towards me
sample-009106,some men were smoking from a gigantic pipe that they passed from one to the other
sample-009107,glad he took the t out of that
sample-009108,he also tried to remember some good stories to relate as he sheared the sheep
sample-009109,the handle snagged my coat
sample-009110,i need you to be spontaneous he asked me out to din din
sample-009111,from here on you will be alone the alchemist said
sample-009112,shakespeare never said that
sample-009113,can i help you
sample-009114,it was only when i got this close to it that the strangeness of it was at all evident to me
sample-009115,nature knows me as the wisest being in creation the sun said
sample-009116,there was very little talking
sample-009117,four hundred and fifty dollars
sample-009118,he had surprised himself with the thought
sample-009119,the art festival was a disaster
sample-009120,how do you know
sample-009121,but he didn't need to worry about that right now
sample-009122,the accommodation was affordable and cosy
sample-009123,that woman stole my purse
sample-009124,i had a dream and i met with a king
sample-009125,don't say that again
sample-009126,there was a fluctuation in the water pressure that fed the whale tank
sample-009127,he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
sample-009128,he just got a new kite for his birthday
sample-009129,i would not recommend publishing the article without the dataset
sample-009130,i didn't mean to shoot him
sample-009131,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
sample-009132,i've got a mother and two kid sisters to care for
sample-009133,sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
sample-009134,i'd love to see you try and convince them of that
sample-009135,none of what the old man was saying made much sense to the boy
sample-009136,his eyes filled with tears as he spoke of the prophet
sample-009137,i've got to go
sample-009138,i bet you she'd know how to say it all right
sample-009139,i came over with johnny
sample-009148,he could see that the old man wanted to know more about his life
sample-009149,the paramedics took out the defibrillator to reanimate the motorcyclist
sample-009158,its lower end was still embedded
sample-009159,they went out of business years ago
sample-009160,he approached the mass and was surprised at the size and the shape
sample-009161,it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience
sample-009162,this fireplace is victorian
sample-009163,when he emerged it was with a young arab dressed in white and gold
sample-009164,my review of the sun one star
sample-009165,if he abandons that pursuit it's because it wasn't truelove
sample-009166,the boy fell to the sand nearly unconscious
sample-009167,the people were also praying to heaven for protection
sample-009170,and the girl pointed to the south indicating that it was there the strange man lived
sample-009171,the dunes are changed by the wind but the desert never changes
sample-009172,but they don't count
sample-009173,it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
sample-009174,the thought was so dreadful to him that he forgot about the heat and went forward
sample-009175,it's extremely suspicious that there's no information about brains that didn't come from a brain
sample-009176,many telescopes were pointed at it
sample-009177,it was bunched up and he had hardly thought of it for a long time
sample-009188,and at that i told him and he took my place
sample-009189,she said she was so exhausted and unhappy that she thought of leaving and she did
sample-009198,the heather was on fire and you could see a thin blue smoke rising up slowly
sample-009199,what's the idea of locking this
sample-009200,too young or too old
sample-009201,the tribal chieftain called for the boy and presented him with fifty pieces of gold
sample-009202,you should read the new book mark twain's writing now
sample-009203,he had suddenly remembered that in tarifa there was an old woman who interpreted dreams
sample-009204,the old man was probably a gypsy too
sample-009205,he wasn't an alchemist
sample-009206,we've done it said the englishman who had also awakened early
sample-009207,why didn't you call me
sample-009210,it must have fallen while i was sitting over there
sample-009211,then taking his sheep he walked away
sample-009212,before the sun had reached its high point five hundred tribesmen appeared on the horizon
sample-009213,he dabbled in painting drawing and photography before finding his true passion
sample-009214,the boy climbed the dune slowly
sample-009215,that's the philosopher's stone and the elixir of life
sample-009216,if my stepfather sold this old sculpture he'd probably become a millionaire
sample-009217,then he turned to the boy
sample-009228,he really was a king
sample-009229,turn on the lights
sample-009238,most meteorites are more or less rounded
sample-009239,men dream more about coming home than about leaving the boy said
sample-009240,there's the professor now
sample-009242,only a few meters away there is a bus station
sample-009243,why do they need gin
sample-009244,the camel driver was seated at the base of a palm tree observing the sunset
sample-009245,the scottish parliament contains politicians
sample-009246,the crowd swayed a little as i elbowed my way through
sample-009247,my review of the sun one star
sample-009248,your son went to serve at a distant place and became a centurion
sample-009249,hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after
sample-009250,the shop is exactly the size i always wanted it to be
sample-009251,there were really i think two or three hundred people elbowing one another
sample-009252,when i first reached through to it i thought the soul of the world was perfect
sample-009253,she was jealous of the girl with polish on her nails and a handsome guy at her side
sample-009254,you could have died after peace had been declared
sample-009256,it would have been visible to me had i only looked up as it passed
sample-009257,when he had completed the cleaning he asked the man for something to eat
sample-009258,it was a cobra whose venom could kill a person in minutes
sample-009259,don't try to enter into the life of the oasis
sample-009260,the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees
sample-009261,do i knock or something
sample-009262,meanwhile the old man persisted in his attempt to strike up a conversation
sample-009263,he had seen the shooting star and was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere nearby
sample-009264,as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
sample-009265,we can't leave greg here
sample-009266,and then he perceived it very slowly
sample-009267,all things are one
sample-009268,sit down and let me treat you to something said the boy
sample-009270,it must have fallen while i was sitting over there
sample-009271,you were seen at the enemy camp three days ago
sample-009272,my wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red green and yellow signal lights
sample-009273,i want to talk to both of you
sample-009274,no one attacks an oasis
sample-009275,some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound
sample-009276,this is christmas eve
sample-009277,i'm not very good at this
sample-009278,he could see that the old man wanted to know more about his life
sample-009279,the boy knew and was now working toward it
sample-009280,he thought of all the married shepherds he had known
sample-009281,the boy was startled
sample-009283,he preferred to sit down and wait
sample-009284,and then they want the person to change
sample-009285,i didn't do nothing
sample-009286,where do you come in
sample-009287,and the names of the people involved were very difficult to pronounce
sample-009288,so he began to wander through the city and found himself at the gates
sample-009289,i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
sample-009290,your money saved us for three days
sample-009291,i was the one up there doing the farting
sample-009292,their faces were covered with the blue cloths and their eyes showed fear
sample-009293,among these people were a couple of cyclists a gardener i employed sometimes and a girl carrying a baby
sample-009294,the boy was startled
sample-009295,if you want it you must take it
sample-009297,aiding an escaped criminal
sample-009298,the boy continued to listen to his heart as they crossed the desert
sample-009299,the arabs laughed at him and the alchemist laughed along
sample-009300,based on the omens of the present
sample-009301,towering buildings form the quintessential skyline
sample-009302,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
sample-009303,because life wants you to achieve your destiny
sample-009304,at night they spread their sleeping gear and kept their fires hidden
sample-009305,but don't worry the alchemist continued
sample-009306,she'll be back in a second
sample-009307,the brake fluid was leaking out onto the path
sample-009308,who's this gal she's gonna marry
sample-009309,are you sure that joe case is going on next week
sample-009310,i wished i had a light to smoke by
sample-009311,the biological threat was contained
sample-009312,during the third year the omens will continue to speak of your treasure and your destiny
sample-009313,he believed in omens
sample-009314,because now he knew where his treasure was
sample-009315,strange images passed through my mind
sample-009316,what am i doing
sample-009317,not always in this way but i always appear in one form or another
sample-009318,one must prepare for it
sample-009319,the top of the cylinder was rotating on its body
sample-009320,i came to tell you just one thing the boy said
sample-009321,who's gonna get him
sample-009322,the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
sample-009323,and i think it's terrific
sample-009324,you were here on my wedding night
sample-009325,in a weeks time we're going to america
sample-009326,it's not what enters men's mouths that's evil said the alchemist
sample-009327,it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
sample-009328,at the first glance it was really not very exciting
sample-009329,ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
sample-009330,that is an antelope my son
sample-009331,the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
sample-009332,and the names of the people involved were very difficult to pronounce
sample-009333,the thought was so dreadful to him that he forgot about the heat and went forward
sample-009334,am i going to find my treasure he asked
sample-009335,you have enough gold to buy many sheep and many camels
sample-009336,they wanted to save the oasis
sample-009337,i came to tell you just one thing the boy said
sample-009338,i didn't want to marry anybody else in town
sample-009339,i'm going to wait here for you every day
sample-009348,will you get out and let me handle this
sample-009349,how about that favor
sample-009358,he believed in omens
sample-009359,sometimes i get so mad at you i can't see straight
sample-009360,this is for you he said holding one of the parts out to the monk
sample-009361,at the camp it was difficult to see anything
sample-009362,the caravan moved toward the east
sample-009363,i shall make us some ice cubes
sample-009364,the same book that taught me about urim and thummim
sample-009365,its time said his father and he was right
sample-009366,what do you want to know
sample-009367,you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
sample-009370,there's a caravan leaving today for alfayoum
sample-009371,i want those stamps
sample-009372,we'll be down with the bags in a minute
sample-009373,i've always looked on bessie as my own sister
sample-009374,they filled three sacks
sample-009375,some went away while i was there and other people came
sample-009376,like eating or sleeping or like seeking love or finding a job
sample-009377,i noticed that the boy answered
sample-009388,so now i'm a camel driver
sample-009389,am i going to find my treasure he asked
sample-009398,and he vanished around the corner of the plaza
sample-009399,i can't let you have my plane
sample-009400,he really was a king
sample-009401,ten minutes ago i had a job
sample-009402,that's big of you
sample-009403,cause you know how politicians are
sample-009404,where are you going
sample-009405,the old man said nothing
sample-009406,the boy offered his bottle hoping that the old man would leave him alone
sample-009407,no one seemed to have thought about it that night
sample-009410,the hookahs were extinguished and the guards stood at attention
sample-009411,because they're still here
sample-009412,it was engineering at its finest
sample-009413,some went away while i was there and other people came
sample-009414,will you try to get some sleep
sample-009415,if something isn't done
sample-009416,some of the grey ash was falling off the circular edge
sample-009417,many people in berkshire surrey and middlesex must have seen it
sample-009428,i'm leaving right now
sample-009429,if a person is living out his destiny he knows everything he needs to know
sample-009438,and the solid part was called the philosopher's stone
sample-009439,it must have fallen while i was sitting over there
sample-009440,the alchemist lighted the fire and soon a delicious aroma filled the tent
sample-009441,you should see the other guy specifically how good at fighting he is
sample-009442,he was excited and at the same time uneasy maybe the girl had already forgotten him
sample-009443,we can both hear
sample-009444,all things are one the old man had said
sample-009445,i burned the omelette
sample-009446,the train pulled into the station
sample-009447,the boy fell to his knees and wept
sample-009448,i am in search of that universal language among other things
sample-009449,we returned to the cemetery
sample-009450,the burning fire had been extinguished
sample-009451,then she again took his hands and studied them carefully
sample-009452,the merchant turned to a customer who wanted three crystal glasses
sample-009453,i had the everyone has gary busey's teeth dream again
sample-009454,he knew all the fields and pastures of andalusia
sample-009455,but men began to reject simple things and to write tracts interpretations and philosophical studies
sample-009456,you just pat him
sample-009457,had our instruments permitted it we might have been able to see the trouble way back when
sample-009458,we speak of them only to children
sample-009459,the horse reared again raising a cloud of dust
sample-009460,but now i'm sad and alone
sample-009461,strange images passed through my mind
sample-009462,i want to spend christmas in california with my family
sample-009463,the boy remembered an old proverb from his country
sample-009464,and then he perceived it very slowly
sample-009465,the shepherd said nothing
sample-009466,the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
sample-009467,one that will write
sample-009468,so now i'm a camel driver
sample-009469,bush leagues mostly
sample-009470,you already know about alchemy
sample-009471,the man was speaking the language of alchemy
sample-009472,at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars
sample-009473,he disappeared into the tent
sample-009474,you would have to have been born an arab to understand he answered
sample-009475,that's good thought the englishman
sample-009476,they are not really friends they just work together and talk from time to time
sample-009477,you have told me about your dreams about the old king and your treasure
sample-009478,you've got the brain of a pancake
sample-009479,to realize one's destiny is a person's only real obligation
sample-009480,you don't have to wait till january
sample-009481,play my romntica playlist
sample-009482,an hour later he had before him a chest of spanish gold coins
sample-009483,because he was terrified the boy didn't answer
sample-009484,rest well tonight as if you were a warrior preparing for combat
sample-009485,i noticed that the boy answered
sample-009486,what are they doing the old man asked pointing at the people in the plaza
sample-009487,the proposed approach provides stateoftheart results at very low computational cost
sample-009488,revenge is not my style but obviously accidents will happen
sample-009489,i had that right here
sample-009490,now where was that hat
sample-009491,he thought of all the married shepherds he had known
sample-009492,it's extremely suspicious that there's no information about brains that didn't come from a brain
sample-009493,tangier is not like the rest of africa
sample-009494,the world speaks many languages the boy thought
sample-009495,bakers have homes while shepherds sleep out in the open
sample-009496,the camel driver though seemed not to be very concerned with the threat of war
sample-009497,what would you do with a gun in your back
sample-009498,without responding the guard entered the tent where he remained for some time
sample-009499,as they began to decorate the hallway a silhouette appeared in the doorway
sample-009500,i'd like to build a display case for the crystal the boy said to the merchant
sample-009501,and now it was only four days before he would be back in that same village
sample-009502,i've always wanted to do this
sample-009503,the boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid responding to her question
sample-009504,and when they do i get mad
sample-009505,it almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted
sample-009506,it's a dream in the language of the world she said
sample-009507,it's all right if you want to smoke your cigar now
sample-009508,he was going to miss the place and all the good things he had learned
sample-009509,and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
sample-009510,when i had my sheep i was happy and i made those around me happy
sample-009511,they're not concerned with that right now
sample-009512,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
sample-009513,they shouted consolation and promises and went off back to the town again to get help
sample-009514,men dream more about coming home than about leaving the boy said
sample-009515,want to give my flower a drink
sample-009516,don't they usually keep the gun on the floor
sample-009517,he placed the dvd into the player
sample-009518,the woman said she had never heard of such a person and hurried away
sample-009519,he had not a cent in his pocket but he had faith
sample-009520,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
sample-009521,now i'm beginning what i could have started ten years ago
sample-009522,what did you do with her
sample-009523,is she running a temperature
sample-009524,hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after
sample-009525,excuse you for what
sample-009526,everything i say is right
sample-009528,i finally have enough money and all the time i need
sample-009529,he has other things to do first
sample-009530,melchizedek watched a small ship that was plowing its way out of the port
sample-009531,i've got to see him
sample-009532,i was impatient to see it opened
sample-009534,it seemed such a little thing so bright and small and still
sample-009535,you already know all you need to know
sample-009536,now give us sixty days on this
sample-009537,it's the oasis said the camel driver
sample-009538,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
sample-009539,the fire burned the fox
sample-009548,they made the boy continue digging but he found nothing
sample-009549,it was dropping off in flakes and raining down on the sand
sample-009558,before this i always looked to the desert with longing said fatima
sample-009559,there must be somebody there
sample-009560,everyone has an opinion about jesus christ
sample-009561,the boy smiled and continued digging
sample-009562,the hand that evokes love and creates a twin soul for every person in the world
sample-009563,i don't know why
sample-009564,when i'm eating that's all i think about
sample-009565,a semitransparent overlay promoted the beta version of an android app
sample-009566,he knew what i was thinking the boy said to himself
sample-009567,it reminded him of the wool from his sheep
sample-009570,because the crystal was dirty
sample-009571,and continue to pay heed to the omens
sample-009572,the fine manufacturing company was a bookkeeper for fourteen years
sample-009573,he was selling better than ever
sample-009574,remember what happened to lisa
sample-009575,one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
sample-009576,and then he perceived it very slowly
sample-009577,the streamer of gas came out towards us
sample-009588,before the sun had reached its high point five hundred tribesmen appeared on the horizon
sample-009589,did she discuss it with you
sample-009598,i'm not good enough to make this one up
sample-009599,judge debra sent me
sample-009600,it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
sample-009601,the computer artist waited for the latest image to render
sample-009602,he suddenly felt tremendously happy
sample-009603,it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
sample-009604,but as time passed tangier had changed
sample-009605,there was a murmur from the crowd
sample-009606,it's not a battle of good against evil
sample-009607,to nourish the falcon
sample-009610,i think they're going to last for a long time he said to the monk
sample-009611,his life and his path had always provided him with enough omens
sample-009612,whatever the thing observed one could find a connection with his experience of the moment
sample-009613,from the railway station in the distance came the sound of trains ringing and rumbling
sample-009614,so it's better to listen to what it has to say
sample-009615,hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after
sample-009616,then came a war
sample-009617,the newspaper articles had prepared everyone for the reception of the idea
sample-009628,only one way you can help me
sample-009629,fifty cents on the dollar
sample-009638,this is as far as the elevator goes
sample-009639,but i'm going in search of my treasure the boy said
sample-009640,i know he wrote them on account of the misspellings
sample-009641,a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder
sample-009642,then suddenly he noticed it with a start
sample-009643,but the englishman appeared not to attach any importance to it
sample-009644,i used to look at those women and envy them their happiness
sample-009645,i'm going to them
sample-009646,you can't believe it's not butter
sample-009647,i want to stay at the oasis the boy answered
sample-009648,should i understand the emerald tablet the boy asked
sample-009649,stuffed tomatoes with rice in the oven is a traditional greek dish
sample-009650,it was a very warm october
sample-009651,and he gave the boy his blessing
sample-009652,the alchemist dismounted and told the escorts they could return to the camp
sample-009653,since the miner had sacrificed everything to his destiny the old man decided to become involved
sample-009654,that's what i mean
sample-009655,that was a little girl named mary hatch
sample-009656,i'm going to hate those who have found their treasure because i never found mine
sample-009657,the girl dropped the container and the water spilled
sample-009658,now you got me
sample-009659,the desert didn't answer him for a few moments
sample-009660,many telescopes were pointed at it
sample-009661,all that time the martians must have been getting ready
sample-009662,men have never understood the words of the wise
sample-009663,he suddenly felt tremendously happy
sample-009664,have you seen him
sample-009665,you're looking for witch doctors he spoke some verses from the koran and moved on
sample-009666,what's the difference between hibernation and standby mode
sample-009667,formatting of tables should be improved
sample-009668,and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
sample-009669,get me walter burns
sample-009670,but there was something there in his heart that wouldn't allow him to do so
sample-009671,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
sample-009672,he took the fourth part and handed it to the monk
sample-009673,they were fascinating stories each of them lived out his destiny to the end
sample-009674,it was bunched up and he had hardly thought of it for a long time
sample-009675,the top had certainly ceased to rotate
sample-009676,the other son was a poet and delighted all of rome with his beautiful verses
sample-009677,janet roger died three months ago
sample-009678,he needs three days answered the alchemist
sample-009679,but they really don't know what they're saying
sample-009680,it's like the flight of those two hawks it can't be understood by reason alone
sample-009681,putting a pool under this floor was a great idea
sample-009682,the omens had been true after all
sample-009683,he's already killed three men
sample-009684,i wonder what molly put in those tacos
sample-009685,i just want to dream about mecca
sample-009686,what good is money to you if you're going to die
sample-009687,never advertise razors by shaving a monkey it's cruel and results in lawsuits
sample-009688,i'm trying to explain to my mother how to get pictures off her phone
sample-009689,the two walked out among the palms
sample-009690,any time but christmas
sample-009691,that doesn't happen to just anyone
sample-009692,he took urim and thummim from his pocket and began playing with them
sample-009693,but you are in the desert
sample-009694,somewhere you are holding the person i love the boy said
sample-009695,now i too will be one of the women who wait
sample-009696,isn't it all too wonderful
sample-009697,sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
sample-009698,i forgot you were here
sample-009699,he remembered what the old man had said about offering something you didn't even have yet
sample-009700,advancing slowly they searched among the stones
sample-009701,it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-009702,the closer he got to the realization of his dream the more difficult things became
sample-009703,these are the spies said one of the men
sample-009704,whatever the thing observed one could find a connection with his experience of the moment
sample-009705,he remembered what the old man had said about offering something you didn't even have yet
sample-009706,reality was permanently scarred from those force field experiments
sample-009707,and then the boy understood
sample-009708,an alchemist said the alchemist
sample-009709,he lives at the alfayoum oasis his friend had said
sample-009710,he was my brother
sample-009711,and you know it as well as i do
sample-009712,he made us stand and watch him paint for like an hour
sample-009713,the men were smoking their hookahs and trading stories from the battlefield
sample-009714,the servers of the common voice project couldn't handle the heavy load
sample-009715,suddenly one of the hawks made a flashing dive through the sky attacking the other
sample-009716,he should have decided to become a shepherd the boy said
sample-009717,the men fell into an animated discussion
sample-009718,no baselines or comparison to state of the art is provided
sample-009719,ill join you in a minute after i lock my bike
sample-009720,replace the ts in tim tebow's name with any other consonant to get a star wars character
sample-009721,i can't very well leave without a pair of water wings
sample-009722,the sun was setting when the boy's heart sounded a danger signal
sample-009723,but before i go i want to tell you a little story
sample-009724,i am in search of that universal language among other things
sample-009725,you said it to me too
sample-009726,greece is the country where democracy was invented
sample-009727,i went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the dark
sample-009728,to show you one of life's simple lessons the alchemist answered
sample-009729,i would have won the junior olympics if not for those medaling kids
sample-009730,i'm getting trevor ready
sample-009731,maybe that's why they give up on it so early too
sample-009732,at least she knows how to behave at funerals
sample-009733,he dressed in his arabian clothing of white linen bought especially for this day
sample-009734,it was only when i got this close to it that the strangeness of it was at all evident to me
sample-009735,go back to watching the caravan he said
sample-009736,the conversation was interrupted by the warehouse boss
sample-009737,others stumbled upon the stone by accident
sample-009738,some do come back
sample-009739,the weights in w can be negative
sample-009748,and he decided he would go to see the chiefs of the tribes
sample-009749,i'm never more aware of a room's acoustics than when i'm trying to enjoy a snack i have no intention of sharing
sample-009758,the old man gave a signal and everyone stood
sample-009759,ask the owner of that stall how much the sword costs he said to his friend
sample-009760,i shall make us some ice cubes
sample-009761,i learned how to care for sheep and i haven't forgotten how that's done
sample-009762,we like to think all our cases are important
sample-009763,the shepherd said nothing
sample-009764,they shouted consolation and promises and went off back to the town again to get help
sample-009765,ten minutes for what
sample-009766,one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
sample-009767,trust in your heart but never forget that you're in the desert
sample-009770,thousands of workers commute from the surroundings into the city each day
sample-009771,the incantation was written in italics
sample-009772,the men climbed the hill and they were tired when they reached the top
sample-009773,the secret is here in the present
sample-009774,or do you think it would spoil him
sample-009775,they eat lunch together often but dont really talk outside the office
sample-009776,give me that call on patrick's wire
sample-009777,henderson stood up with a spade in his hand
sample-009788,what do i do in salem the old man laughed
sample-009789,in those days very few of the people had any idea about astronomy
sample-009798,there was a moment of silence so profound that it seemed the city was asleep
sample-009799,i was scared but wasted no time in going out and crossing the bridge to the sand pits
sample-009808,your husband must have been in a great hurry
sample-009809,it reminded him of the wool from his sheep
sample-009818,it brought his heart into his mouth
sample-009819,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
sample-009820,i'm just a fool
sample-009821,it was faintly marked with transverse stripes and slightly flattened from the perfect round
sample-009822,it's just exactly what i wanted
sample-009823,where your treasure is there also will be your heart the alchemist had told him
sample-009824,i don't understand what you're talking about the desert said
sample-009825,mostly just the hearts of those who are trying to realize their destinies
sample-009826,are children more creative than adults
sample-009827,i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
sample-009830,my mind ran on the possibilities of its content
sample-009831,then he dropped his spade picked up his jacket and came out into the road
sample-009832,it sounded like a gypsy prayer
sample-009833,he says it's the chance of a lifetime
sample-009834,down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
sample-009835,but use them to buy your flock
sample-009836,they began to ride out over the sands with the moon lighting their way
sample-009837,then came the night of the first falling star
sample-009840,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
sample-009841,well then we've got a problem
sample-009842,i'm not afraid to die
sample-009843,their horses cried out and all their weapons were filled with sand
sample-009844,the young arab took out a book and began to read
sample-009845,the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
sample-009846,she went over to mr jared's house
sample-009847,will you come here
sample-009848,so he asked if the old man's blessing was still with him
sample-009849,i hope it doesn't plunge jillian into bankruptcy

sample-009852,thirty every thursday sixty at sixty who knows what
sample-009853,did you finish the interview

sample-009855,wish i had a million dollars
sample-009856,he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
sample-009857,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
sample-009858,go out and find her
sample-009859,they ate in silence
sample-009860,the new law was retroactive
sample-009861,the desert didn't answer him for a few moments
sample-009862,you're a smart young woman
sample-009863,why can't she get along with me
sample-009864,some of the grey ash was falling off the circular edge
sample-009865,don't say those things
sample-009866,it drew a droplet of blood
sample-009867,that's never happened to me the boy said
sample-009868,but then he stopped
sample-009869,we're just travelers the alchemist answered
sample-009870,he wasn't an alchemist
sample-009871,this morning i found a calculator taped to my wii
sample-009872,why the shots stopped after the tenth no one on earth has tried to explain
sample-009873,the shepherd swore that he would
sample-009874,i didn't say anything
sample-009875,it would have been visible to me had i only looked up as it passed
sample-009876,i hope it works
sample-009877,this kettle is quicker at boiling water than the old one
sample-009878,what about higgins against becca
sample-009879,that's true enough the boy thought ruefully
sample-009880,then i take it there are no objections
sample-009881,i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit
sample-009882,replace the ts in tim tebow's name with any other consonant to get a star wars character
sample-009883,but he takes advantage of you
sample-009884,mostly just the hearts of those who are trying to realize their destinies
sample-009885,the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees
sample-009886,of course the two were unable to do anything
sample-009887,i can clean up those glasses in the window if you want said the boy
sample-009888,his father said no more
sample-009889,you should see the other guy specifically how good at fighting he is
sample-009890,you jump i jump
sample-009891,its lower end was still embedded
sample-009892,the woman was silent for some time
sample-009893,there's a moon out tonight
sample-009894,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
sample-009895,but as he saw them lying there on the ground another phrase came to his mind
sample-009896,it could have been steel silver or platinum
sample-009897,there was no respite to be had
sample-009898,do you know someone here who cures people's illnesses the boy asked
sample-009899,we always observe the tradition
sample-009900,suddenly a huge quantity of green smoke came out of the pit in three puffs and went straight into the still air
sample-009901,she wants to talk to uncle francis
sample-009902,since the miner had sacrificed everything to his destiny the old man decided to become involved
sample-009903,tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself
sample-009904,the boy felt a pang in his heart thinking about the merchant's daughter
sample-009905,so now i'm a camel driver
sample-009906,the englishman could not contain his excitement
sample-009907,there was a murmur from the crowd
sample-009908,then the two went off to have some more tea
sample-009909,you used to be able to pitch better than that
sample-009910,they shouted consolation and promises and went off back to the town again to get help
sample-009911,in general people have difficulties estimating risks correctly
sample-009912,you've resented me from the first moment you saw me
sample-009913,camels are traitorous they walk thousands of paces and never seem to tire
sample-009914,i thought that everything i owned would be destroyed
sample-009915,so what do you want of me the sun asked
sample-009916,from the railway station in the distance came the sound of trains ringing and rumbling
sample-009917,paracetamol should get rid of that pain
sample-009918,i'm going to them
sample-009919,i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
sample-009920,he doesn't have anything else
sample-009921,ask the owner of that stall how much the sword costs he said to his friend
sample-009922,where'd you get it
sample-009923,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
sample-009924,henderson went into the railway station to telegraph the news to london
sample-009925,the stranger seemed satisfied with the answer
sample-009926,every image processing software contains automatic contrast and color enhancement
sample-009927,the boy remembered an old proverb from his country
sample-009928,he took his money from his pouch and showed it to the young man

sample-009930,when i returned to the common the sun was setting
sample-009931,we must be good
sample-009932,no more tickets left
sample-009933,later we simply let life proceed in its own direction toward its own fate
sample-009934,like everybody learns he said
sample-009935,i have the diet of a kid who found twenty dollars
sample-009936,who's this gal she's gonna marry
sample-009937,there was a time when for me a camel's whinnying was nothing more than whinnying
sample-009938,now i can see that it hasn't been too bad
sample-009939,do you care if i sit down out here
sample-009940,the old man opened his cape and the boy was struck by what he saw
sample-009941,paper cups are bad for the environment if you throw them in the garbage

sample-009950,well why don't we go there right now the boy asked

sample-009953,he called to the boy and they took a walk along the dunes surrounding the encampment

sample-009978,march was windy and dark
sample-009979,they're just a pile of stones
sample-009980,then she took both of his hands in hers and began quietly to pray
sample-009981,from then on he would make his own decisions
sample-009982,i have been wanting to go and waiting for him to go with me
sample-009983,don't say anything fatima interrupted
sample-009984,it was difficult not to think about what he had left behind

sample-010032,take hold of the cover
sample-010033,but where are the houses

sample-010040,don't say that again

sample-010047,but only speak a word and my servant will be healed
sample-010048,the boy remembered an old proverb from his country
sample-010049,but i found it difficult to get to work because of the investigations
sample-010050,i want to tell you a story about dreams said the alchemist
sample-010051,the model has effectively three fully connected layers
sample-010052,everything you need to know you have learned through your journey

sample-010064,it's not i the wind spoke about

sample-010066,worked hard just to have food and water like the sheep
sample-010067,crooks don't pay taxes

sample-010070,i've crossed these sands many times said one of the camel drivers one night
sample-010071,i was impatient to see it opened
sample-010072,not what you'd call rich
sample-010073,it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience
sample-010074,we're just travelers the alchemist answered
sample-010075,they'll be here any minute
sample-010077,he left without saying goodbye to the crystal merchant
sample-010078,he thought of the merchant's daughter and was sure that she had probably married
sample-010079,looking through the telescope i saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet

sample-010096,some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound
sample-010097,they returned to the gates of the monastery
sample-010098,two years ago right here on this spot i had a recurrent dream too
sample-010099,am i going to find my treasure he asked
sample-010100,and here's a kiss for you
sample-010101,several figures approached him
sample-010102,don't tell me you were worried
sample-010103,in those days very few of the people had any idea about astronomy
sample-010104,what is it that i still need to know the boy asked
sample-010105,when i returned to the common the sun was setting
sample-010106,and one or two persons were returning
sample-010107,the oasis is neutral ground
sample-010108,as soon as he saw me among the crowd he called to me to come down
sample-010109,the old man was probably a gypsy too
sample-010110,henderson was taking it in
sample-010111,be careful with your prognostications said the stranger
sample-010112,and that's another thing
sample-010113,there isn't any more wine
sample-010114,we don't know what's in the confounded thing do you
sample-010115,the alchemist is two hundred years old the englishman had told him

sample-010125,all that time the martians must have been getting ready
sample-010126,step right up here
sample-010127,some went away while i was there and other people came
sample-010128,will you put that thing away
sample-010129,because we're panicky and he's not
sample-010130,wait just a minute now
sample-010131,but where are the houses
sample-010132,people from all over the world have passed through this village son said his father
sample-010133,on the second day the boy climbed to the top of a cliff near the camp
sample-010134,the heat lasted until nightfall and all that time he had to carry his jacket
sample-010135,if something isn't done
sample-010136,we all agree on a peaceful solution
sample-010137,a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder
sample-010138,being with him alone made her feel uncomfortable
sample-010139,there's no danger the boy said when they had moved on past the encampment
sample-010140,but he still couldn't flee
sample-010141,i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
sample-010142,even if you cleaned my crystal for an entire year
sample-010143,we were all made by the same hand and we have the same soul
sample-010144,the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
sample-010145,and there were dunes rocks and plants that insisted on living where survival seemed impossible
sample-010146,a boy came running towards me
sample-010147,it was my fear of failure that first kept me from attempting the master work
sample-010150,we cannot forget that farce
sample-010151,strange images passed through my mind
sample-010152,mozzarella is a creamy cheese that goes well with tomato and basil
sample-010153,i feel grateful for the time that we have spend together
sample-010154,he got up early with the idea of finding it
sample-010155,heehaw and merry christmas
sample-010156,but try editing a file with several hundred lines and you'll find that this is pretty clunky
sample-010157,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
sample-010168,if we serve tea in crystal the shop is going to expand
sample-010169,in those days very few of the people had any idea about astronomy
sample-010178,what idiot wrote this total drivel
sample-010179,well then why do we need all these books the boy asked
sample-010180,you bet i've got a better offer
sample-010181,you're the one who may die the alchemist said
sample-010182,sometimes their caravan met with another
sample-010183,i wasn't born yesterday
sample-010184,and at that i told him and he took my place
sample-010185,they shouted consolation and promises and went off back to the town again to get help
sample-010186,it's a direct line to both my office and my apartment
sample-010187,you're worth more dead than alive
sample-010190,this was the strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space
sample-010191,hitting the delete and escape keys did nothing
sample-010192,when the sun sets the men will once again surrender their arms to me
sample-010193,what is love the desert asked
sample-010194,because my eyes are not yet accustomed to the desert the boy said

sample-010196,all things are one the old man had said
sample-010197,business has really improved he said to the boy after the customer had left
sample-010208,if we serve tea in crystal the shop is going to expand
sample-010209,they crossed the desert for another two days in silence
sample-010218,you don't have to be rich skinny popular or even own a cape to perform a random act of kindness
sample-010219,it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience
sample-010220,our group played guitars while the others randomly hit resonant objects
sample-010221,it was the second or third time they'd tried
sample-010222,the suspension bridge was swinging in the gale
sample-010223,there were snickers from the background
sample-010224,that's a christmas present from a very dear friend of mine
sample-010225,i wished i had a light to smoke by
sample-010226,i'm an alchemist simply because i'm an alchemist he said as he prepared the meal
sample-010227,but everything had changed
sample-010230,makes about five thousand a year
sample-010231,what's the matter with you
sample-010232,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
sample-010233,but he's on the right track
sample-010234,that's what alchemists do
sample-010235,it doesn't matter he said to his sheep
sample-010236,but i never said anything like that
sample-010237,and above all don't forget to follow your destiny through to its conclusion
sample-010240,the airplane rose gracefully into the sky
sample-010241,and so do i
sample-010242,coming home a party of tourists passed us singing and playing music

sample-010244,how do you think i got here
sample-010245,do you need any help
sample-010246,of course the two were unable to do anything
sample-010247,let me formulate a response to that question
sample-010248,there's been an accident
sample-010249,this is a ludicrous situation
sample-010250,better get a pencil out and write it down
sample-010251,as the flag unfurled they all hollered like wild beasts
sample-010252,what'll it take till the bank reopens
sample-010253,just what is the lowdown on williams
sample-010254,from the railway station in the distance came the sound of trains ringing and rumbling
sample-010255,i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
sample-010256,he saw the boy appear from the other side of the dunes
sample-010257,there was very little talking
sample-010258,i'll just watch him he said to himself
sample-010259,everyone has his or her own way of learning things he said to himself
sample-010260,a whole week in bermuda
sample-010261,from there he could see africa in the distance
sample-010262,he suggested that the boy look around the palace and return in two hours
sample-010263,the boy trusted his new friend
sample-010264,our merchants bought that man and brought him to egypt
sample-010265,the achieved results are far behind the stateoftheart in image classification
sample-010266,it's not my house
sample-010267,the boy was startled
sample-010268,a long note was sounded on a bugle and everyone mounted up
sample-010269,help my friend mr richard
sample-010270,you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
sample-010271,i needed immediate access
sample-010272,the horse reared again raising a cloud of dust
sample-010273,then suddenly he noticed it with a start
sample-010274,he had helped him out in a dangerous situation
sample-010275,in his heart he wanted to remain awake but he also wanted to sleep
sample-010276,a card hanging in the doorway announced that several languages were spoken in the shop
sample-010277,that's the magic of omens said the boy
sample-010278,the night was warm and i was thirsty
sample-010279,the alchemist knocked on the gate of the monastery
sample-010280,you already know about alchemy
sample-010281,when the blinding dust had settled a bit the boy trembled at what he saw
sample-010282,what is an alchemist he asked finally
sample-010283,the sun was turned into a golden disk
sample-010284,you'll have to wake him up
sample-010285,i'm not going very far the alchemist answered looking straight into the eyes of the horsemen
sample-010286,i found these one day in the fields
sample-010287,don't say those things
sample-010288,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
sample-010289,have you seen him yet
sample-010290,he stood irresolute for a moment and then scrambled out of the pit
sample-010291,did she discuss it with you
sample-010292,they called that discovery the master work  it was part liquid and part solid
sample-010293,then you'll die in the midst of trying to realize your destiny
sample-010294,it seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of here
sample-010295,let's stop this another commander said
sample-010296,you killed all three of them for nothing
sample-010297,where are we going to put him
sample-010298,it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
sample-010299,i didn't do it
sample-010300,because he knew what he would find
sample-010301,some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound
sample-010302,this is the press room
sample-010303,hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after
sample-010304,he regretted having spoken to the camel driver about what he had seen in the desert
sample-010305,he made us stand and watch him paint for like an hour
sample-010306,i had the everyone has gary busey's teeth dream again
sample-010307,he took out one of the stones
sample-010308,don't say that again
sample-010309,he knew what i was thinking the boy said to himself
sample-010310,what am i doing
sample-010311,something terribly important's happened
sample-010312,beat it out and get hold of some guys
sample-010313,the old man wore a breastplate of gold and he knew about my past
sample-010314,his hands began to tremble and the woman sensed it
sample-010315,the director has a crush on the actress i think
sample-010316,he told her about the morning's meeting
sample-010317,remember to take your full course of antibiotics stopping early is dangerous for your health

sample-010319,what can i do now
sample-010320,hundreds must have seen it and taken it for a falling star
sample-010321,the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
sample-010322,my wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red green and yellow signal lights
sample-010323,i don't know who anybody is any more
sample-010324,somewhere you are holding the person i love the boy said
sample-010325,do you mind if i sit down
sample-010326,it was a great relief
sample-010327,if good things are coming they will be a pleasant surprise said the seer
sample-010328,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
sample-010329,but the alchemist continued to look to the horizon
sample-010330,what's my name doing on it
sample-010331,we don't know what's in the confounded thing do you
sample-010332,please take a business card
sample-010333,my name is deborah
sample-010334,but that left me without any honest means of support
sample-010335,i just don't trust anyone who says they've never had hamburger helper
sample-010336,says for us to go the limit
sample-010337,i think you're crazy
sample-010338,ronnie watched in horror as the mirror transformed
sample-010339,as was mecca for the merchant
sample-010340,maybe we'd better ask someone the boy suggested
sample-010341,they continued across the desert
sample-010342,when he speaks in our language i can interpret what he has said
sample-010343,never ever have a boxing match with ali
sample-010344,then he dropped his spade picked up his jacket and came out into the road
sample-010345,the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees
sample-010346,he took urim and thummim from his pocket and began playing with them
sample-010347,even me  i haven't thought of other women since i met the merchant's daughter
sample-010350,you know where i live
sample-010351,it was dropping off in flakes and raining down on the sand
sample-010352,they must be used to their new shepherd and have probably already forgotten me
sample-010353,can i get a woot woot
sample-010354,times are different now
sample-010355,don't you dare to be civil with me
sample-010356,but that was simply because my eye was tired
sample-010357,the guitar broke and she couldn't play anymore
sample-010368,what is a foreigner doing here asked another of the men
sample-010369,a boy came running towards me
sample-010378,and at that i told him and he took my place
sample-010379,i locked eyes with a fish in the tank
sample-010380,it's what you have always wanted to accomplish
sample-010381,i notice you still remember it
sample-010382,i'm not gonna talk about them
sample-010383,much better said the old man
sample-010384,it seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of here
sample-010385,it's extremely suspicious that there's no information about brains that didn't come from a brain
sample-010386,wait a minute
sample-010387,the road was so steep that the biker had to shift down a few gears
sample-010390,maktub thought the boy
sample-010391,eventually the merchant had to hire two more employees
sample-010392,they are so used to me that they know my schedule he muttered
sample-010393,and i'd better read your books said the boy
sample-010394,maybe she didn't even remember him
sample-010395,what had been next to him five minutes ago was now at the other side
sample-010396,you'll be the counselor of the oasis
sample-010397,and maybe it wasn't that they were teaching me but that i was learning from them
sample-010408,he had seen the shooting star and was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere nearby
sample-010409,graham had trained rigourously
sample-010418,the old man leafed through the book and fell to reading a page he came to
sample-010419,first he had studied esperanto then the world's religions and now it was alchemy
sample-010420,it was the first time she had done that
sample-010421,its time said his father and he was right
sample-010422,mostly just the hearts of those who are trying to realize their destinies
sample-010423,they stood there looking at the moon
sample-010424,i myself heard nothing of that
sample-010425,i'm surprised you didn't run into her
sample-010426,we've got to get to them
sample-010427,i'll go further than that
sample-010430,what's the matter
sample-010431,business has really improved he said to the boy after the customer had left
sample-010432,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
sample-010433,of course the most important question is whether it actually works better than the old eye tracker
sample-010434,he looked around at the empty plaza again feeling less desperate than before
sample-010435,please take a business card
sample-010436,in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
sample-010437,that's true the boy thought
sample-010440,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
sample-010441,some of the grey ash was falling off the circular edge
sample-010442,give them a little third degree
sample-010443,that tina thought it was funny
sample-010444,if we serve tea in crystal the shop is going to expand
sample-010445,why the shots stopped after the tenth no one on earth has tried to explain
sample-010446,just teach me to be the wind for a few moments the boy said
sample-010447,been seeing me in your dreams
sample-010448,why didn't you ask neal about it
sample-010449,studying these key phrases will help you while traveling
sample-010450,that day the merchant gave the boy permission to build the display
sample-010451,the boy looked around for the ovens and other apparatus used in alchemy but saw none
sample-010452,he took back his books and packed them away again in their bags
sample-010453,he got up early with the idea of finding it
sample-010454,and you know it
sample-010455,then get out of here
sample-010456,you are almost at the end of your journey said the alchemist
sample-010457,you already know all you need to know
sample-010458,i'm going home and see my wife and family
sample-010459,there was no way for everybody to know about alchemy
sample-010460,i wished i had a light to smoke by
sample-010461,everyone seemed very excited
sample-010462,they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
sample-010463,when i returned to the common the sun was setting
sample-010464,the shaking disturbed the rat nest
sample-010465,i don't believe it
sample-010466,when i returned to the common the sun was setting
sample-010467,i thought about whether we should find coins and models in it and so on
sample-010468,will you give me your blessing asked the boy
sample-010469,the boy was shocked
sample-010470,with the girl with the raven hair his days would never be the same again
sample-010471,but they were engaged
sample-010472,you must mean two other trees
sample-010473,since the miner had sacrificed everything to his destiny the old man decided to become involved
sample-010474,the boy went to the well every day to meet with fatima
sample-010475,that baker he said to himself without completing the thought
sample-010476,i'd like to build a display case for the crystal the boy said to the merchant
sample-010477,the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
sample-010478,the book was written in spanish
sample-010479,let's the alchemist answered
sample-010480,are you sure there's no mistake
sample-010481,formatting of tables should be improved
sample-010482,i locked eyes with a fish in the tank
sample-010483,bravery is the ability to overcome fear
sample-010484,you've never been born
sample-010485,i couldnt stop staring at it
sample-010486,it's no miracle because i see it happen once every year
sample-010487,the merchants were assembling their stalls and the boy helped a candy seller to do his
sample-010488,i'm going to hate those who have found their treasure because i never found mine
sample-010489,and if you improve on the present what comes later will also be better
sample-010490,i have the money i need to buy my sheep
sample-010491,i am following my destiny
sample-010492,we're coming to a new order of things
sample-010493,my mind ran on the possibilities of its content
sample-010494,it was dropping off in flakes and raining down on the sand
sample-010495,i'm sending it over with beth
sample-010496,the next day the boy returned to the well hoping to see the girl
sample-010497,the miner had abandoned everything to go mining for emeralds
sample-010498,that's when he'll be safe and not a minute before
sample-010499,the animals were exhausted and the men talked among themselves less and less
sample-010500,and at that i told him and he took my place
sample-010501,its lower end was still embedded
sample-010502,he prepared himself a sandwich and drank some hot tea from a crystal glass
sample-010503,please don't be lazy
sample-010504,but the tradition also says that we should believe the messages of the desert
sample-010505,it could have been written much more clearly
sample-010506,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
sample-010507,the arabs laughed at him and the alchemist laughed along
sample-010508,where'd you get it
sample-010509,the webs standards are made by the wc
sample-010510,they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
sample-010511,i am father now can you believe it
sample-010512,they might even have become friends but the englishman closed off the conversation
sample-010513,the sea has lived on in this shell because that's its destiny
sample-010514,this puts me in a peculiar hole
sample-010515,the boy prodded them one by one with his crook calling each by name
sample-010516,and at that i told him and he took my place
sample-010517,the three fell silent
sample-010518,henderson was taking it in
sample-010519,i've got a mother and two kid sisters to care for
sample-010520,don't ask me why i don't know why
sample-010521,is she coming back here
sample-010522,i'd like to change places with you for just one day
sample-010523,this cup is made of polystyrene
sample-010524,he had already seen many people come and go and the desert remained as it was
sample-010525,air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
sample-010526,you don't have to be rich skinny popular or even own a cape to perform a random act of kindness
sample-010527,maybe we'd better call herman
sample-010528,so that those who have the responsibility for understanding can understand he said
sample-010529,i need some time to think
sample-010530,they walked together through the narrow streets of tangier
sample-010531,have you got that money
sample-010532,his heart squeezed as if his chest had suddenly compressed it
sample-010533,he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
sample-010534,from where i am the sun said i can see the soul of the world
sample-010535,can't you just observe men and omens in order to understand the language the boy asked
sample-010536,image registration and invariant representations could both be done in a computationally very efficient way
sample-010537,the woman said she had never heard of such a person and hurried away
sample-010538,you have enough gold to buy many sheep and many camels
sample-010539,continue in the direction of the pyramids said the alchemist
sample-010540,when the lead had become liquid the alchemist took from his pouch the strange yellow egg
sample-010541,i just know that the tradition is always right
sample-010542,i'm sending it over with beth
sample-010543,he wasn't asking for help
sample-010544,i think you're a great guy
sample-010545,the hookahs were extinguished and the guards stood at attention
sample-010546,a long note was sounded on a bugle and everyone mounted up
sample-010547,a large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered
sample-010550,what a terrible thing to say
sample-010551,but that's why you created the game in the first place the boy answered
sample-010552,he remembered the sword
sample-010553,don't hurt my finger again
sample-010554,that's why i was sent down here
sample-010555,so he began to wander through the city and found himself at the gates
sample-010556,the end of the cylinder was still as ogilvy and henderson had left it
sample-010557,there was very little talking
sample-010568,i'm trying to explain to my mother how to get pictures off her phone
sample-010569,who wrote that speech for you
sample-010578,you came so that you could learn about your dreams said the old woman
sample-010579,the day was hot and the wine was refreshing
sample-010580,it almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted
sample-010581,if only we could see it
sample-010582,he still calls his mother 'mummy'
sample-010583,and you've told me nothing along the way said the boy
sample-010584,strange images passed through my mind
sample-010585,there's gold here he said
sample-010586,death doesn't change anything the boy thought
sample-010587,lemme have the desk
sample-010590,how about that favor
sample-010591,i don't know how to turn them into reality
sample-010592,he spent the entire morning observing the infrequent comings and goings in the street
sample-010593,how does anything like this ever start
sample-010594,the horse reared again raising a cloud of dust
sample-010595,can i help you asked the man behind the window
sample-010596,you're just like father used to be
sample-010597,the simum blew that day as it had never blown before
sample-010608,out with larry's deputies
sample-010609,he gets scared and goes into hiding
sample-010618,the woman sat down and told him to be seated as well
sample-010619,the old man said nothing
sample-010620,no one seemed to have thought about it that night
sample-010621,i just want to dream about mecca
sample-010622,she will also announce the third party's candidate for the presidency
sample-010623,when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
sample-010624,i don't want to change anything because i don't know how to deal with change
sample-010625,ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
sample-010626,you have been a real blessing to me
sample-010627,i have known true alchemists the alchemist continued
sample-010630,when the simum ceased to blow everyone looked to the place where the boy had been
sample-010631,it was starlight and i explained the signs of the zodiac to her
sample-010632,the boy fell to his knees and wept
sample-010633,in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
sample-010634,i know he wrote them on account of the misspellings
sample-010635,my father fell in love with him
sample-010636,something older than humanity more ancient than the desert
sample-010637,the woman was silent for some time
sample-010640,in the united states we use paper bags for shopping
sample-010641,the people will enjoy the tea and want to buy the glasses
sample-010642,it was the time of day when all of spain slept during the summer
sample-010643,and what do you do in salem he insisted
sample-010644,because for him you are a green field from which he always returns with game
sample-010645,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
sample-010646,air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
sample-010647,i know its dimensions and how it behaves
sample-010648,the two men hurried back and found the cylinder still lying in the same position
sample-010649,he placed urim and thummim in the chest
sample-010650,it was only when i got this close to it that the strangeness of it was at all evident to me
sample-010651,the boy awoke as the sun rose
sample-010652,i never knew he had a diary
sample-010653,my foot must have slipped
sample-010654,revenge is not my style but obviously accidents will happen
sample-010655,is it for humans
sample-010656,drinking too much coke can cause diabetes
sample-010657,to read more about my story check out my first post adventures in handsfree coding
sample-010658,it must have fallen while i was sitting over there
sample-010659,then the thing came upon him in a flash
sample-010660,you dominated those horsemen with the way you looked at them he said
sample-010661,my name is deborah
sample-010662,the heuristic function is just an estimate of the lag
sample-010663,men dream more about coming home than about leaving the boy said
sample-010664,i have already found my treasure
sample-010665,show me where there is life out in the desert
sample-010666,one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
sample-010667,so what should i do now the boy asked
sample-010668,others stumbled upon the stone by accident
sample-010669,what is a foreigner doing here asked another of the men
sample-010670,and in that way the months passed
sample-010671,somehow the purple colour faded to gray
sample-010672,meanwhile the boy thought about his treasure
sample-010673,in any case it's good that you've learned that everything in life has its price
sample-010674,everybody knows you're a sweetheart
sample-010675,they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
sample-010676,the boy prodded them one by one with his crook calling each by name
sample-010677,the boy was sad as he left her that day
sample-010678,rate this novel four stars
sample-010679,the man wept with happiness
sample-010680,a poor little fellow that never meant nobody no harm
sample-010681,we're going to take her over to my private office
sample-010682,the boy thought about the crystal merchant
sample-010683,can i come in
sample-010684,i'm never more aware of a room's acoustics than when i'm trying to enjoy a snack i have no intention of sharing
sample-010685,absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
sample-010686,he remembered something his grandfather had once told him that butterflies were a good omen
sample-010687,it was a strange furnace fueled by firewood with a transparent flask heating on top
sample-010688,grandma is fearless
sample-010689,drawing from my own experience as a learner of english and german i value engaging activities that involve everyday conversation
sample-010690,there was a time when for me a camel's whinnying was nothing more than whinnying
sample-010691,had our instruments permitted it we might have been able to see the trouble way back when
sample-010692,the boy approached her to ask about the alchemist
sample-010693,as the sun rose the men began to beat the boy
sample-010694,wish i had a million dollars
sample-010695,i'm dying for what i believe
sample-010696,that rollercoaster was insane
sample-010697,he's already killed three men
sample-010698,and the alchemist understood that the boy's heart had returned to the soul of the world
sample-010699,all that time the martians must have been getting ready
sample-010700,coming home a party of tourists passed us singing and playing music
sample-010701,judge may not think so
sample-010702,he wanted to forget about the vision and return to his meditation
sample-010703,maybe we'd better ask someone the boy suggested
sample-010705,so what do you want of me the sun asked
sample-010706,he was already re accustomed to desert's silence
sample-010707,my chemist told me to take these tablets before eating
sample-010708,i was scared but wasted no time in going out and crossing the bridge to the sand pits
sample-010709,the desert with its endless monotony put him to dreaming
sample-010711,there goes another scrub lady
sample-010712,the desert takes our men from us and they don't always return she said
sample-010713,your behavior is embarrassing go learn the art of social intercourse
sample-010714,i never knew grandma to be so determined before
sample-010715,why the shots stopped after the tenth no one on earth has tried to explain
sample-010716,patrick has terminal cancer
sample-010717,get me walter burns
sample-010718,and he came down after the game with a contract
sample-010719,on the following day the first clear sign of danger appeared
sample-010720,and if it is
sample-010721,it is still a phenomenal movement
sample-010722,we speak of them only to children
sample-010723,he was twenty minutes from his tent and began to make his way there
sample-010724,younger man what he had seen and the man asked him to wait there
sample-010725,you have no children
sample-010726,the caravan began to travel day and night
sample-010727,the camel driver was seated at the base of a palm tree observing the sunset
sample-010728,you should see the other guy specifically how good at fighting he is
sample-010729,the end of the cylinder was still as ogilvy and henderson had left it
sample-010730,debian is an operating system which is free as in freedom
sample-010731,no hope no adventure no old kings or destinies no treasure and no pyramids
sample-010732,it was better than the scent of the hookahs
sample-010733,let me touch you
sample-010734,drawing from my own experience as a learner of english and german i value engaging activities that involve everyday conversation
sample-010735,the poor boy stood in the rain
sample-010736,it means only that the heart does what it can the alchemist said
sample-010737,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
sample-010739,that night there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet
sample-010740,wearing his new sandals he descended the stairs silently
sample-010741,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
sample-010742,it swayed in the air like weeping willows
sample-010743,they seemed to laugh at him and he laughed back his heart bursting with joy
sample-010744,you'd better get your friends
sample-010745,the drivers carried the freight themselves over such treacherous footing and then reloaded the camels
sample-010746,you should read the new book mark twain's writing now
sample-010747,how can you have any happiness after that
sample-010750,no he heard a voice on the wind say
sample-010751,i'm a desert woman and i'm proud of that
sample-010752,am i talking too much
sample-010753,i saw him get it
sample-010754,you go on and practice
sample-010755,i'm going to find kyle's mother
sample-010756,the boy wanted to take her hand
sample-010757,don't say that again
sample-010768,one night the father had a dream
sample-010769,what do you say
sample-010778,he loosened the reins on his horse who galloped forward over the rocks and sand
sample-010779,you mean you don't approve of my having a baby
sample-010780,most meteorites are more or less rounded
sample-010781,the rocking motion was nauseating
sample-010782,i'm not afraid of failing
sample-010783,i was just in town earlier this year so it is kind of crazy to think about what took place right after
sample-010784,is it all right
sample-010785,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
sample-010786,and get me a pen
sample-010787,now i'm beginning what i could have started ten years ago
sample-010790,it considers the horizontal dimension as time
sample-010791,i can personally vouch for his character
sample-010792,stop treating me like a child
sample-010793,this is no time to give up
sample-010794,from here on you will be alone the alchemist said
sample-010795,i'll work all night until dawn and i'll clean every piece of crystal in your shop
sample-010796,tomorrow sell your camel and buy a horse
sample-010797,does a man's heart always help him the boy asked the alchemist
sample-010800,everything has been written by the same hand
sample-010801,there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
sample-010802,i can only tell you what i saw
sample-010803,the boy was surprised at his thoughts
sample-010804,amazingly the wall made of iron didn't feel cold
sample-010805,when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
sample-010806,a lot of patience but shepherds know all about patience
sample-010807,the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
sample-010810,the wind screamed with delight and blew harder than ever
sample-010811,one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
sample-010812,how do you think the table looks
sample-010813,but i found it difficult to get to work because of the investigations
sample-010814,wait a minute here
sample-010815,they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
sample-010816,the medical industry saves lives
sample-010817,can i get a woot woot
sample-010828,i'd love to see you try and convince them of that
sample-010829,have a good look
sample-010838,seventeen minutes later she was in the water and nearly drowned
sample-010839,you can't stay here
sample-010840,i'll go right after it
sample-010841,it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
sample-010842,it was the old man who spoke first
sample-010843,i'm going to hate those who have found their treasure because i never found mine
sample-010844,she needs to get her transcripts and passport first
sample-010845,and we had a bite
sample-010846,i don't much like change he said
sample-010847,my friend was getting married and asked me to be her maid of honor
sample-010848,have a good trip
sample-010849,i didn't know shepherds knew how to read said a girl's voice behind him
sample-010850,at the first glance it was really not very exciting
sample-010851,and maybe it wasn't that they were teaching me but that i was learning from them
sample-010852,did you get it
sample-010853,many telescopes were pointed at it
sample-010854,everyone when they are young knows what their destiny is
sample-010855,the new law was retroactive
sample-010856,the strange horseman drew an enormous curved sword from a scabbard mounted on his saddle
sample-010857,how to avoid a massive dieoff of the colony
sample-010858,it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
sample-010859,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
sample-010860,that night there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet
sample-010861,sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
sample-010862,and the falcon then nourishes man
sample-010863,i'm a desert woman and i'm proud of that
sample-010864,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
sample-010865,coming home a party of tourists passed us singing and playing music
sample-010866,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
sample-010867,with the girl with the raven hair his days would never be the same again
sample-010868,they dismounted and the alchemist said nothing
sample-010869,it's easy and yet i've never done it before he thought
sample-010870,that night he told all of this to the alchemist
sample-010871,where do you think you're going
sample-010872,it's what you have always wanted to accomplish
sample-010873,and there were dunes rocks and plants that insisted on living where survival seemed impossible
sample-010874,i'll never get this speech right
sample-010875,they walked in from the rain all dishevelled and steaming
sample-010876,you may kiss my hand
sample-010877,there were really i think two or three hundred people elbowing one another
sample-010878,the sun was turned into a golden disk
sample-010879,can you do your stuff
sample-010880,what'll it take till the bank reopens
sample-010881,what's the matter with you two
sample-010882,it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience
sample-010883,i'm afraid you put them on too early
sample-010884,that gives you an idea of what i'm up against
sample-010885,i'm an adventurer looking for treasure he said to himself
sample-010886,breakfast is usually earlier than this she thought
sample-010887,men dream more about coming home than about leaving the boy said
sample-010888,gary pulled another coin from his pouch
sample-010889,from that day on it was the desert that would be important
sample-010890,i find that the best way to combat this issue is to use the builtin vocabulary editor
sample-010891,your luck's not with you now
sample-010892,but you don't know about love
sample-010893,is that what you want me to tell vincent
sample-010894,suddenly one of the hawks made a flashing dive through the sky attacking the other
sample-010895,i'll keep you in mind
sample-010896,on the second day the boy climbed to the top of a cliff near the camp
sample-010897,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
sample-010898,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
sample-010899,hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after
sample-010900,looking through the telescope i saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet
sample-010901,but she hadn't charged him anything
sample-010902,he had seen the shooting star and was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere nearby
sample-010903,i'm not hiding anything the boy answered
sample-010904,but there they saw a crystal shop that offered refreshing mint tea
sample-010905,i want my husband to wander as free as the wind that shapes the dunes
sample-010906,look at those shoulders
sample-010907,the boy was startled
sample-010908,been seeing me in your dreams
sample-010909,i shall make us some ice cubes
sample-010910,the levanter increased in intensity
sample-010911,my tax dollars pay for those public school proms
sample-010912,henderson was taking it in
sample-010913,how did it start
sample-010914,why didn't you deliver them right away
sample-010915,what's the idea of locking this
sample-010916,as secretary you can hire anyone you like
sample-010917,there isn't any more wine
sample-010918,the thirteenth of march is meant to be unlucky
sample-010919,i have watched the caravan as it crossed the desert he said
sample-010920,about eleven i walked back to my home in maybury because nothing seemed to be happening
sample-010921,he moved about invisible but everyone could hear him
sample-010922,where's the old goat
sample-010924,wait just a minute now
sample-010925,richard has gone camping by himself
sample-010926,once again he was experiencing the language without words
sample-010927,i never saw it before
sample-010928,the level ground was blackened as far as one could see and it was still giving off smoke
sample-010929,and at that i told him and he took my place
sample-010930,you can't stay here
sample-010931,the conversation was interrupted by the warehouse boss
sample-010932,looking through the telescope i saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet
sample-010933,they'll believe him
sample-010934,his life and his path had always provided him with enough omens
sample-010935,dense clouds of smoke or dust can be seen through a powerful telescope
sample-010936,i was just in town earlier this year so it is kind of crazy to think about what took place right after
sample-010938,the man wept with happiness
sample-010939,don't forget that everything you deal with is only one thing and nothing else
sample-010948,did you get him
sample-010949,how long is what
sample-010958,the two were taken to a nearby military camp
sample-010959,you have helped me the man continued to prepare his tea saying nothing
sample-010960,air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
sample-010961,he wants me to write down only things that i think about but not things i plan to do
sample-010962,he put it in his back pocket
sample-010963,they're not my children
sample-010964,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
sample-010965,we just lost our heads and acted like a mob
sample-010966,somewhere you are holding the person i love the boy said
sample-010967,the boy saw a man appear behind the counter
sample-010970,don't let them see that you're afraid the alchemist said
sample-010971,it sounded like a gypsy prayer
sample-010972,she's going to lose her mind when she finds out
sample-010973,one afternoon one of his servants fell ill and it appeared that he would die
sample-010974,because we're the people and we're tough
sample-010975,but there's a tribal war the boy reiterated
sample-010976,you got fifty cents
sample-010977,to nourish the falcon
sample-010988,you've forgotten my milk
sample-010989,and that's where the power of love comes in
sample-010998,the kangaroo hopped noisily
sample-010999,the old man wore a breastplate of gold and he knew about my past
sample-011000,we lit the lantern and walked over to his house
sample-011001,let me formulate a response to that question
sample-011002,they think i'm working with them
sample-011003,the two men hurried back and found the cylinder still lying in the same position
sample-011004,i came to tell you just one thing the boy said
sample-011005,it's not i the wind spoke about
sample-011006,when i'm eating that's all i think about
sample-011007,not everyone can see his dreams come true in the same way
sample-011008,the boy accustomed to recognizing omens spoke to the merchant
sample-011009,i'm not going very far the alchemist answered looking straight into the eyes of the horsemen
sample-011010,but as time passed tangier had changed
sample-011011,i want you to be my wife
sample-011012,i heard a faint movement under my feet
sample-011013,click twice on the browser's icon to open it
sample-011014,i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit
sample-011015,you know where she lives
sample-011016,i got two giant bug bites on my right leg from last night and they hurt
sample-011017,the war is going to end someday the girl said
sample-011018,studying these key phrases will help you while traveling
sample-011019,henderson was taking it in
sample-011020,the arabs laughed at him and the alchemist laughed along
sample-011021,don't tell me you didn't know it was loaded
sample-011022,give me my book the boy said
sample-011023,the stranger continued to hold the sword at the boy's forehead
sample-011024,he almost began to tell about his treasure but decided not to do so
sample-011025,rest well tonight as if you were a warrior preparing for combat
sample-011026,toward the end of the afternoon they came upon a coptic monastery
sample-011027,because life wants you to achieve your destiny
sample-011028,where is the treasure he asked
sample-011029,strange images passed through my mind
sample-011030,he loosened the reins on his horse who galloped forward over the rocks and sand
sample-011031,stand by to contact amanda
sample-011032,of course the two were unable to do anything
sample-011033,if you start your emails with greetings let me be the first to welcome you to earth
sample-011034,i was scared but wasted no time in going out and crossing the bridge to the sand pits
sample-011035,of course you never did
sample-011036,as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
sample-011037,business has really improved he said to the boy after the customer had left
sample-011038,the alchemist stopped abruptly and bent to the ground
sample-011039,nearby was the englishman reading a book
sample-011048,life attracts life the alchemist answered
sample-011049,i'm going to wait here for you every day
sample-011058,i learned how to care for sheep and i haven't forgotten how that's done
sample-011059,it's like the camel driver said 'eat when it's time to eat
sample-011060,they stood there looking at the moon
sample-011061,some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound
sample-011062,do you know what an engagement ring is
sample-011063,wait for the signal
sample-011064,i don't like people to do that because the sheep are afraid of strangers
sample-011065,must have been a pretty good pitcher
sample-011066,it's the master work of the alchemists
sample-011067,the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
sample-011070,it brought his heart into his mouth
sample-011071,do you know what cia stands for
sample-011072,the corruption ran deep
sample-011073,he noticed the unequal cooling of its surface
sample-011074,are you sure there's no mistake
sample-011075,there was a loud shriek from a woman standing behind us
sample-011076,the tribal chieftain called for the boy and presented him with fifty pieces of gold
sample-011077,wait a minute here
sample-011088,i would have won the junior olympics if not for those medaling kids
sample-011089,did you learn anything the englishman asked eager to hear what it might be
sample-011098,to continue his search for the treasure meant that he had to abandon fatima
sample-011099,from then on he would make his own decisions
sample-011100,i've been looking for you all morning he said as he led the boy outside
sample-011101,he just got a new kite for his birthday
sample-011102,the boy approached her to ask about the alchemist
sample-011103,that's why i'm an angel second class
sample-011104,he paused and his eyes were still unfriendly
sample-011105,open a terminal and execute a program
sample-011106,she'll be all right
sample-011107,they might even have become friends but the englishman closed off the conversation
sample-011110,can i help you asked the man behind the window
sample-011111,then she filled her vessel with water and left
sample-011112,'m all about those invisible cosmic connections that transcend time and distance
sample-011113,it was rising slowly and painfully out of the cylinder
sample-011114,we can't let the chronicle get the laugh on us
sample-011115,one day the earth began to tremble and the nile overflowed its banks
sample-011116,he recited an our father silently
sample-011117,we're just slowly plodding through some user interviews at the moment
sample-011128,it was a very warm october
sample-011129,all things are one the old man had said
sample-011138,you mean you've known about her all along
sample-011139,i was impatient to see it opened
sample-011140,many of our soldiers teamed up
sample-011141,but the boy was quiet
sample-011142,she never grew up
sample-011143,hundreds must have seen it and taken it for a falling star
sample-011144,i have a taxi waiting downstairs
sample-011145,i don't want to rush you
sample-011146,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
sample-011147,suddenly he disappeared and i could hear a faint shriek behind the walls
sample-011148,i hope it works
sample-011149,but you don't know about love
sample-011150,they are so used to me that they know my schedule he muttered
sample-011151,my tax dollars pay for those public school proms
sample-011152,it's for annabelle
sample-011153,it brought his heart into his mouth
sample-011154,i'm surprised the boy said
sample-011155,she just called me
sample-011156,the emerald tablet is a direct passage to the soul of the world
sample-011157,in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
sample-011158,sometimes i appear in the form of a solution or a good idea
sample-011159,have a good look
sample-011160,he recited an our father silently
sample-011161,there are powerful forces on both sides and the war is important to both armies
sample-011162,the city was still sleeping
sample-011163,you brought a new feeling into my crystal shop
sample-011164,what have you done kevin
sample-011165,the display was underwhelming
sample-011166,no one said a word as the old man continued
sample-011167,the heather was on fire and you could see a thin blue smoke rising up slowly
sample-011168,some storms are worth the wreckage
sample-011169,it's called the principle of favorability
sample-011170,the guy thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to stop him
sample-011171,he thought of the woman who had trusted in the desert
sample-011172,i would have won the junior olympics if not for those medaling kids
sample-011173,you had me worried
sample-011174,he disappeared into the tent
sample-011175,but i found it difficult to get to work because of the investigations
sample-011176,they seemed to laugh at him and he laughed back his heart bursting with joy
sample-011177,in his hand he grasped a snake by the tail
sample-011178,there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
sample-011179,i didn't have time to get some stylish underwear
sample-011180,no he heard a voice on the wind say
sample-011181,eventually the merchant had to hire two more employees
sample-011182,the tin was made from aluminium
sample-011183,but don't worry the alchemist continued
sample-011184,my tax dollars pay for those public school proms
sample-011185,that's the way it always is said the old man
sample-011186,the boy said nothing
sample-011187,it was starlight and i explained the signs of the zodiac to her
sample-011188,i'd like to build a display case for the crystal the boy said to the merchant
sample-011189,even though the sheep didn't teach me to speak arabic
sample-011190,this morning i found a calculator taped to my wii
sample-011191,who's got the room next to hers
sample-011192,but coding without a mouse or a keyboard
sample-011193,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
sample-011194,that damn mouse could sense my anger
sample-011195,the big charleston contest
sample-011196,no that's not what i mean
sample-011197,they called it the simum and it was worse than a storm at sea
sample-011198,i need you to be spontaneous he asked me out to din din
sample-011199,several figures approached him
sample-011200,upon returning to the wise man he related in detail everything he had seen
sample-011201,and they had understood each other perfectly well
sample-011202,the cursor blinked expectantly
sample-011203,you're right when you say my father was no business man
sample-011204,but nowhere could he find his new companion
sample-011205,shopping for clothes online can be a hard task
sample-011206,i'm a woman of the desert she said averting her face
sample-011207,so what should i do now the boy asked
sample-011208,i know he wrote them on account of the misspellings
sample-011209,maybe it was because they moved around so much
sample-011210,'everyone loved them and enjoyed them
sample-011211,then he turned to the boy
sample-011212,but don't let him interrupt you
sample-011213,some storms are worth the wreckage
sample-011214,a line of flame high can be seen in the atmosphere
sample-011215,the englishman vanished too gone to find the alchemist
sample-011216,he really was a king a wise king
sample-011217,the owner of the bar came over and looked as well
sample-011218,he condemned the commander to death without honor
sample-011219,the boy noticed that the owner of the bar stood nearby listening attentively to their conversation
sample-011220,the men fell into an animated discussion
sample-011221,the boy thanked him ate it and went on his way
sample-011222,the nearby city of ceuta had grown faster than tangier and business had fallen off
sample-011223,in some places the ground was covered with the salt of driedup lakes
sample-011224,you gave them everything i had the boy said
sample-011225,august may have ended early
sample-011226,i ain't seen him for a week
sample-011227,one is loved because one is loved
sample-011228,there are a lot of seats over there
sample-011229,i wanted them to be a part of your inheritance
sample-011230,i want to look at my flower
sample-011231,when he's an old man he's going to spend a month in africa
sample-011232,how'd you get out
sample-011233,the crowd swayed a little as i elbowed my way through
sample-011234,in those times the master work could be written simply on an emerald
sample-011235,don't say that again
sample-011236,to continue his search for the treasure meant that he had to abandon fatima
sample-011237,there was very little talking
sample-011238,i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
sample-011239,but men began to reject simple things and to write tracts interpretations and philosophical studies
sample-011248,it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-011249,many of whom are homeless and hungry
sample-011258,he recited an our father silently
sample-011259,is your husband with you
sample-011260,the war is going to end someday the girl said
sample-011261,well then we've got a problem
sample-011262,and then they want the person to change
sample-011263,they crossed the desert for another two days in silence
sample-011264,air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
sample-011265,because i've always heard about them the boy answered saying nothing about his dream
sample-011266,of course the two were unable to do anything
sample-011267,it's late in the evening a perfect time for coffee
sample-011270,the englishman was unable to sleep one night
sample-011271,not always in this way but i always appear in one form or another
sample-011272,turning the air conditioning on leads to an increased fuel consumption
sample-011273,although searching in binary search trees is efficient you won't find any fruits in there
sample-011274,i want you to be my wife
sample-011275,the greatest authority on meteorites stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles
sample-011276,before him was an enormous white horse rearing over him with a frightening scream
sample-011277,exactly answered the alchemist
sample-011288,the boy didn't want to talk about the pyramids
sample-011289,a shepherd may like to travel but he should never forget about his sheep
sample-011298,the newspaper articles had prepared everyone for the reception of the idea
sample-011299,you may not have a great deal of time
sample-011300,only we call them agents
sample-011301,all that time the martians must have been getting ready
sample-011302,want someone to take you home
sample-011303,all this happened between sunrise and sunset the boy thought
sample-011304,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
sample-011305,just by looking at them
sample-011306,but the boy never took his eye off his new friend
sample-011307,you have a mania for simplifying everything answered the englishman irritated
sample-011310,what did you stop it for
sample-011311,he had tried in vain to establish a relationship with an alchemist
sample-011312,and to do that you need money
sample-011313,the people were also praying to heaven for protection
sample-011314,maybe it was because they moved around so much
sample-011315,my tax dollars pay for those public school proms
sample-011316,with the girl with the raven hair his days would never be the same again
sample-011317,my wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red green and yellow signal lights
sample-011328,and the odor of the animals became a bit more tolerable
sample-011329,he had seen the shooting star and was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere nearby
sample-011338,gives you an idea of the season
sample-011339,they set off running wildly into the trees
sample-011341,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
sample-011342,i'm beginning to think women make the best spies
sample-011343,she could still be alive
sample-011344,there is a universal language understood by everybody but already forgotten
sample-011345,somebody's driving this cab
sample-011346,ogilvy watched till one and then gave up
sample-011347,in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
sample-011348,they become a part of everything
sample-011349,let's the alchemist answered
sample-011350,i've already told you
sample-011351,and continue to pay heed to the omens
sample-011352,he's not a failure
sample-011353,that's the magic of omens said the boy
sample-011355,i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
sample-011356,you can't bribe me
sample-011357,it's a code said the boy a bit disappointed
sample-011358,you bet your bottom dollar we would
sample-011359,she ought to be here any minute
sample-011360,i've seen guys like you go under before
sample-011361,that's why i'm an angel second class
sample-011362,that's the philosopher's stone and the elixir of life
sample-011363,henderson stood up with a spade in his hand
sample-011364,he went to the vending machine and bought a coffee
sample-011365,they won't let me go
sample-011366,always ask an objective question
sample-011367,and the names of the people involved were very difficult to pronounce
sample-011369,and then they want the person to change
sample-011370,a boy came running towards me
sample-011371,my name is deborah
sample-011372,they're not for sale he said
sample-011373,and i'd better read your books said the boy
sample-011374,you seem to think i've never done this before
sample-011375,the englishman had been profoundly impressed by the story
sample-011376,except for the dream
sample-011377,at that point the omens will tell you that your treasure is buried forever
sample-011378,so the wind blew with all its strength and the sky was filled with sand
sample-011379,i'll just go upstairs and send it over with a messenger
sample-011380,shall i pray for him
sample-011381,how did you learn to read the girl asked at one point
sample-011382,this isn't for me to decide
sample-011384,i am definitely open to the idea because ive always wanted to work as a small business owner
sample-011385,then suddenly they kneel and die
sample-011386,and eventually man will nourish your sands where the game will once again flourish
sample-011387,there was enough there to buy a lot of weapons
sample-011388,because my eyes are not yet accustomed to the desert the boy said
sample-011389,he was planning as he left the bar
sample-011390,they might even have become friends but the englishman closed off the conversation
sample-011391,how long since we've seen each other
sample-011392,and continue to pay heed to the omens
sample-011393,people talk a lot about omens thought the shepherd
sample-011394,as he did so he talked with the monk about the tribal wars
sample-011395,i shall make us some ice cubes
sample-011396,and it's not love to see everything from a distance like you do
sample-011398,but arms cannot be drawn unless they also go into battle
sample-011399,he looked around at the empty plaza again feeling less desperate than before
sample-011400,but he found it much more interesting to observe the caravan and listen to the wind
sample-011401,joel is a good guy
sample-011402,some men were smoking from a gigantic pipe that they passed from one to the other
sample-011403,he was betting on that outcome
sample-011404,the frog climbed the tower
sample-011405,was that question rhetorical
sample-011406,based on the omens of the present
sample-011407,there was surely a baker in her town
sample-011408,the adventures of tom sawyer
sample-011409,it's the other foreigner the englishman
sample-011410,read all about it
sample-011411,so we their hearts speak more and more softly
sample-011412,but my heart is agitated the boy said
sample-011413,the merchant turned to a customer who wanted three crystal glasses
sample-011414,rest well tonight as if you were a warrior preparing for combat
sample-011415,now i too will be one of the women who wait
sample-011416,the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees
sample-011417,and he gave the boy his blessing
sample-011418,you wanna take this outside
sample-011419,a line of flame high can be seen in the atmosphere
sample-011420,he was selling better than ever
sample-011421,you'll be the counselor of the oasis
sample-011422,the alchemist erased the circle in the sand and the snake slithered away among the rocks
sample-011423,it was glaringly hot not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind
sample-011424,bacon pancakes and maple syrup is a hearty start to any day
sample-011425,it's called the principle of favorability
sample-011427,then suddenly he noticed it with a start
sample-011428,but don't worry the alchemist continued
sample-011429,you weren't here to build them
sample-011430,in general people have difficulties estimating risks correctly
sample-011431,how can you have any happiness after that
sample-011433,do i look as funny as you do
sample-011434,every image processing software contains automatic contrast and color enhancement
sample-011435,he's always making a speech
sample-011436,the merchant turned to a customer who wanted three crystal glasses
sample-011437,and a million and one other things
sample-011438,the beer was more than just refreshing it was delicious
sample-011439,i'm going to put her through college
sample-011448,the top of the cylinder was rotating on its body
sample-011449,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
sample-011458,eventually the merchant had to hire two more employees
sample-011459,this man looked exactly the same except that now the roles were reversed
sample-011460,did you finish the interview
sample-011461,i think it is
sample-011462,it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-011463,in any case it's good that you've learned that everything in life has its price
sample-011464,i told him that was what i had come here to learn
sample-011465,look at that face
sample-011466,i want to tell you a story about dreams said the alchemist
sample-011467,i don't want anything for myself
sample-011470,even though the sheep didn't teach me to speak arabic
sample-011471,i want my husband to wander as free as the wind that shapes the dunes
sample-011472,the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees
sample-011473,for dinner they had cesar salad
sample-011474,that was the law of hospitality
sample-011475,but there was a sixth day the sun went on
sample-011476,you have no car
sample-011477,the two men hurried back and found the cylinder still lying in the same position
sample-011488,i'm supposed to know my way around
sample-011489,ask the owner of that stall how much the sword costs he said to his friend
sample-011498,i thought about whether we should find coins and models in it and so on
sample-011499,and it's not love to see everything from a distance like you do
sample-011500,as he looked at the stones he felt relieved for some reason
sample-011501,just get me home
sample-011502,and then he perceived it very slowly
sample-011503,it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
sample-011504,he got up adjusted his clothing and picked up his pouch
sample-011505,there's no law against stealing stolen money
sample-011506,may i see it
sample-011507,a large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered
sample-011510,look at the bottle you took the powder from
sample-011511,they were fascinating stories each of them lived out his destiny to the end
sample-011512,he had no idea how he was going to transform himself into the wind
sample-011513,and he looked out over the desert that had brought him to the woman he loved
sample-011514,arabs often appeared in the city shopping and chanting their strange prayers several times a day
sample-011515,all they think about is food and water
sample-011516,did you say a king he asked
sample-011517,mayonnaise is made from eggs oil vinegar and mustard
sample-011528,but that was simply because my eye was tired
sample-011529,the alchemist knocked on the gate of the monastery
sample-011538,i can see that right now
sample-011539,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
sample-011540,because of the omens the alchemist answered
sample-011541,the newspaper articles had prepared everyone for the reception of the idea
sample-011542,hundreds of yelling people are swarming into the park like locusts
sample-011543,men have never understood the words of the wise
sample-011544,there were three hundred wells fifty thousand date trees and innumerable colored tents spread among them
sample-011545,something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top
sample-011546,who told you about omens the boy's interest was increasing by the moment
sample-011547,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
sample-011548,can i get a woot woot
sample-011549,the proportions were all wrong
sample-011550,this cup is made of polystyrene
sample-011551,eventually the merchant had to hire two more employees
sample-011552,give me that call on patrick's wire
sample-011553,mosquitoes are annoying in the summer and can even transmit illnesses
sample-011554,sports music cooking and other topics are covered
sample-011555,most of them were staring quietly at the big table
sample-011556,when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
sample-011557,the men fell into an animated discussion
sample-011558,do you understand that
sample-011559,they were relieved and happy
sample-011560,i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit
sample-011561,nobody ever changes around here
sample-011562,and don't forget the language of omens
sample-011563,because you will never again be able to keep it quiet
sample-011564,he had found where his treasure was and was frightened at what might happen
sample-011565,the city was still sleeping
sample-011566,henderson went into the railway station to telegraph the news to london
sample-011567,the streamer of gas came out towards us
sample-011568,he had seen the shooting star and was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere nearby
sample-011569,it was a cobra whose venom could kill a person in minutes
sample-011570,then he realized that he had been distracted for a few moments looking at the sword
sample-011571,and i told harry i thought i'd be bored to death
sample-011572,where'd you get it
sample-011573,a shepherd may like to travel but he should never forget about his sheep
sample-011574,i'm in the pink of condition
sample-011575,they were looking only for gold his companion answered
sample-011576,how about a little service
sample-011577,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
sample-011578,you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
sample-011579,has melanie scott been in the papers
sample-011580,how strange africa is thought the boy
sample-011581,on the third day the chief met with his officers
sample-011582,and then the boy understood
sample-011583,you came so that you could learn about your dreams said the old woman
sample-011584,from atop its walls one can catch a glimpse of africa
sample-011585,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
sample-011586,as was mecca for the merchant
sample-011587,he fondled his bright orange beard
sample-011588,that baker he said to himself without completing the thought
sample-011589,my seven year resume gap is marked not drugs
sample-011590,the football jocks laughed viciously
sample-011591,he wanted to say so to the alchemist but he was afraid of the man
sample-011592,it must have fallen while i was sitting over there
sample-011593,i'm going to them
sample-011594,the men were terrified at his sorcery
sample-011595,i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
sample-011596,i will be back soon
sample-011597,you're in luck you two the fat arab said
sample-011598,cashier's got your check
sample-011599,we know that and we are used to it
sample-011600,i'll make such a mess of things without you
sample-011601,he got up early with the idea of finding it
sample-011602,the steel of its blade glittered in the light of the moon
sample-011603,he was more confident in himself though and felt as though he could conquer the world
sample-011604,here's some cheese you like
sample-011605,and don't bump into anything
sample-011606,when he's an old man he's going to spend a month in africa
sample-011607,i want to do something big and something important
sample-011608,watch out for his venom the boy said
sample-011609,but before i go i want to tell you a little story
sample-011610,because i don't live in either my past or my future
sample-011611,its lower end was still embedded
sample-011612,hires two personal trainers and make one of them train the other one
sample-011613,you wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town
sample-011614,the two men hurried back and found the cylinder still lying in the same position
sample-011615,what are these things he asked
sample-011616,most people there take it out pretty early in life
sample-011617,if you start your emails with greetings let me be the first to welcome you to earth
sample-011618,i forgot you were here
sample-011619,putting a pool under this floor was a great idea
sample-011620,it's like the flight of those two hawks it can't be understood by reason alone
sample-011621,that night he told all of this to the alchemist
sample-011622,the greatest authority on meteorites stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles
sample-011623,but all she really ever wanted was a home
sample-011624,for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
sample-011625,he can't hurt anybody
sample-011626,what do i do in salem the old man laughed
sample-011627,another dreamer said the ticket seller to his assistant watching the boy walk away
sample-011628,remember the interview i wrote with alice wellman
sample-011629,i'm coming fatima he said
sample-011630,ogilvy watched till one and then gave up
sample-011631,he was selling better than ever
sample-011632,i didn't frisk him
sample-011633,promise you'll never lie the way snoopy did
sample-011634,then came the night of the first falling star
sample-011635,the alchemist knocked on the gate of the monastery
sample-011636,the gods should not have desires because they don't have destinies
sample-011637,this is for you
sample-011638,they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
sample-011639,at his side was the young arab the boy had spoken with earlier
sample-011648,a shepherd may like to travel but he should never forget about his sheep
sample-011649,he saw the boy appear from the other side of the dunes
sample-011658,he told fatima that at their next meeting
sample-011659,it was a litmus test
sample-011660,and it goes for you too
sample-011661,the years of research the magic symbols the strange words and the laboratory equipment
sample-011662,he's allergic to him
sample-011663,the englishman was disappointed
sample-011664,i recommend mouseless browsing for firefox and vimium for chrome
sample-011665,he had suddenly remembered that in tarifa there was an old woman who interpreted dreams
sample-011666,the authors claim to specifically address variations due to geometric transformations in the acquired images
sample-011667,and he immediately felt peace in his heart
sample-011670,then came the night of the first falling star
sample-011671,jim became head of the draft board
sample-011672,on the first day he returned with a rabbit and on the second with two birds
sample-011673,the greatest authority on meteorites stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles
sample-011674,the falcon's beak carries bits of me myself the desert said
sample-011675,i would appreciate if you could create a concise table
sample-011676,the streamer of gas came out towards us
sample-011677,he came to understand its dodges and tricks and to accept it as it was
sample-011688,and in that mood he was grateful to be in love
sample-011689,i tried to tell you right away but you started reminiscing
sample-011698,the top of the cylinder was rotating on its body
sample-011699,he really was a king
sample-011700,the alchemist followed as the boy's horse ran for almost half an hour
sample-011701,many people in berkshire surrey and middlesex must have seen it
sample-011702,absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
sample-011703,on the second day the boy climbed to the top of a cliff near the camp
sample-011704,what's your name he asked
sample-011705,the levanter increased in intensity
sample-011706,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
sample-011707,and then he perceived it very slowly
sample-011710,but the boy couldn't even speak
sample-011711,they mounted their horses
sample-011712,that man is terrific
sample-011713,the alchemist dismounted and told the escorts they could return to the camp
sample-011714,i wouldn't take that too seriously
sample-011715,the old man wore a breastplate of heavy gold covered with precious stones
sample-011716,in sewing you use seam rippers to cut seams
sample-011717,my initial assumption about the phase displaced pulse was wrong
sample-011728,at least we've finally got something we can celebrate
sample-011729,you must not let up even after having come so far he continued
sample-011738,i don't want anything for myself
sample-011739,the end of the cylinder was still as ogilvy and henderson had left it
sample-011740,why are you carrying money asked the tribesman when he had searched the boy's bag
sample-011741,but i sort of like him
sample-011742,everyone has his or her own way of learning things he said to himself
sample-011743,i think they're going to last for a long time he said to the monk
sample-011744,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
sample-011745,this recording is corrupted
sample-011746,it all happened rather suddenly
sample-011747,the tribal chieftains will see that and you'll be dismissed from your position as counselor
sample-011748,well why don't we go there right now the boy asked
sample-011749,replace the ts in tim tebow's name with any other consonant to get a star wars character
sample-011750,his hands began to tremble and the woman sensed it
sample-011751,a long note was sounded on a bugle and everyone mounted up
sample-011752,it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-011753,most meteorites are more or less rounded
sample-011754,the kangaroo hopped noisily
sample-011755,on the seventh day the alchemist decided to make camp earlier than usual
sample-011756,you can't see the planet with the naked eye
sample-011757,all that time the martians must have been getting ready
sample-011758,a lot of patience but shepherds know all about patience
sample-011759,the lead had dried into the shape of the pan but it was no longer lead
sample-011760,he could always go back to being a shepherd
sample-011761,when i returned to the common the sun was setting
sample-011762,some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound
sample-011763,he was shaken into wakefulness by someone
sample-011764,what do you want
sample-011765,maybe he really is a fool
sample-011766,you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
sample-011767,it was the levanter the wind that came from africa
sample-011768,the pat anthony party
sample-011769,servants came and went with silver trays laden with spices and tea
sample-011770,i heard a faint movement under my feet
sample-011771,at the first glance it was really not very exciting
sample-011772,i was wondering if you could tell me a bit more about what it's like to live and work there
sample-011773,at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
sample-011774,but i didnt think that it contained any living creature
sample-011775,it was a useful reminder to complete the task
sample-011776,an huge hole had been made by the impact of the projectile
sample-011777,this desert was once a sea he said
sample-011778,keep your shirt on
sample-011779,ii was terribly worried
sample-011780,what are you afraid of melissa
sample-011781,he doesn't have anything else
sample-011782,no one can be from many places the boy said
sample-011783,all that time the martians must have been getting ready
sample-011784,for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
sample-011785,i really hope i can earn a badge for finishing the class
sample-011786,she as a member of the king's holy knights had sworn an oath
sample-011787,reality was permanently scarred from those force field experiments
sample-011788,he had been to the village only once the year before
sample-011789,the young arab took out a book and began to read
sample-011790,we're going to take her over to my private office
sample-011791,i don't think i know that one
sample-011792,it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
sample-011793,the old man was probably a gypsy too
sample-011794,the desert didn't answer him for a few moments
sample-011795,a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder
sample-011796,i thought that someday i'd be rich and could go to mecca
sample-011797,i wished i had a light to smoke by
sample-011798,well why don't you go to mecca now asked the boy
sample-011799,am i going to find my treasure he asked
sample-011800,it said that the darkest hour of the night came just before the dawn
sample-011801,then who are you
sample-011802,why can't you get along with her
sample-011803,there's no danger the boy said when they had moved on past the encampment
sample-011804,but she'll be there
sample-011805,she would never know the difference because she didn't know how to read
sample-011806,this is christmas eve
sample-011807,and also by unhappiness envy and jealousy
sample-011808,i can't imagine who did it
sample-011809,the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
sample-011810,yesterday he felt invincible now he has a hangover
sample-011811,it was the first time she had done that
sample-011812,but there's a tribal war the boy reiterated
sample-011813,i understand that it is your dataset and that it is new
sample-011814,that's why i was sent down here
sample-011815,for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
sample-011816,it was papa that sends you flowers every day
sample-011817,the horizon was tinged with red and suddenly the sun appeared
sample-011818,and he told what he had seen
sample-011819,between roast beef and potatoes how can we lose
sample-011820,i'm proud of it
sample-011821,what did you stop it for
sample-011822,we used all your imgination to design the place
sample-011823,let us in on it
sample-011824,the boy went to his room and packed his belongings
sample-011825,sometimes it's better to be with the sheep who don't say anything
sample-011826,everything in the universe evolved he said
sample-011827,ogilvy watched till one and then gave up
sample-011828,but i didnt think that it contained any living creature
sample-011829,but i didnt think that it contained any living creature
sample-011830,i thought that someday i'd be rich and could go to mecca
sample-011831,so it's better to listen to what it has to say
sample-011832,and also because i know about the soul of the world he thought to himself
sample-011833,with the girl with the raven hair his days would never be the same again
sample-011834,it was dropping off in flakes and raining down on the sand
sample-011835,he had found where his treasure was and was frightened at what might happen
sample-011836,you gave them everything i had the boy said
sample-011837,but before i go i want to tell you a little story
sample-011838,the boy went to the well every day to meet with fatima
sample-011839,it was glaringly hot not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind
sample-011840,but use them to buy your flock
sample-011841,he started to read the book he had bought
sample-011842,the crowd swayed a little as i elbowed my way through
sample-011843,but this payment goes well beyond my generosity the monk responded
sample-011844,and in that way the months passed
sample-011845,the boy listened quietly
sample-011846,then we can go up to the falls
sample-011847,how do people celebrate good weather over there
sample-011850,the fool flew all the way up here in a blizzard
sample-011851,and then he perceived it very slowly
sample-011852,he had seen kings and beggars walking the desert sands
sample-011853,how do i guess at the future
sample-011854,and he vanished around the corner of the plaza
sample-011855,i'm never more aware of a room's acoustics than when i'm trying to enjoy a snack i have no intention of sharing
sample-011856,he moved about invisible but everyone could hear him
sample-011857,don't say that again
sample-011868,but when the reign of tiberius ended his poems were forgotten
sample-011869,absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
sample-011878,i'll be back the boy said
sample-011879,only get me back to my husband and kids
sample-011880,no one can verify your results
sample-011881,ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
sample-011882,don't give in to your fears said the alchemist in a strangely gentle voice
sample-011883,why do they need gin
sample-011884,he carried two dead hawks over his shoulder
sample-011885,a large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered
sample-011886,other servants maintained the fires in the hookahs
sample-011887,he had never imagined that questions about life would be of such importance to a shepherd
sample-011890,they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
sample-011891,it was the pure language of the world
sample-011892,you'll never get it out of me
sample-011893,the caravans had been stopped at giza for some time waiting for the wars to end
sample-011894,let's the alchemist answered
sample-011895,the man wept with happiness
sample-011896,the boy knew a lot of people in the city
sample-011897,something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top
sample-011908,you should see the other guy specifically how good at fighting he is
sample-011909,and i will tell you how to find the hidden treasure
sample-011918,as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
sample-011919,he told fatima that at their next meeting
sample-011920,it's too bad that he's quickly going to forget my name he thought
sample-011921,survival of the casualties stays our top priority
sample-011922,i'll be next door

sample-012178,the englishman didn't answer him directly
sample-012179,i used to live near el cairum he said
sample-012180,the stranger continued to hold the sword at the boy's forehead
sample-012181,they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house

sample-012193,you want the moon
sample-012194,the englishman was unable to sleep one night

sample-012197,here i am between my flock and my treasure the boy thought
sample-012208,he was already re accustomed to desert's silence
sample-012209,i didn't fall in
sample-012218,it's a dream in the language of the world she said

sample-012227,by letting me help you
sample-012230,i locked eyes with a fish in the tank
sample-012231,i haven't heard the baby complain yet
sample-012232,it's almost as if he had been here and left his mark he thought
sample-012233,they spoke about mercury salt dragons and kings and he didn't understand any of it
sample-012234,the desert didn't answer him for a few moments
sample-012235,what about this job
sample-012236,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
sample-012237,that life may always have flavor
sample-012240,with the girl with the raven hair his days would never be the same again
sample-012241,the sea has lived on in this shell because that's its destiny
sample-012242,it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
sample-012243,who is this stranger who speaks of omens asked one of the chieftains eyeing the boy
sample-012244,it required no explanation just as the universe needs none as it travels through endless time
sample-012245,one million two hundred and fifty thousand dollars
sample-012246,amen
sample-012247,that's the kind of stuff they want
sample-012248,worked hard just to have food and water like the sheep
sample-012249,then how do i know this is your office
sample-012250,maybe because that wasn't really his dream
sample-012251,but i felt miserable watching him wither away like a shriveled dandelion
sample-012252,and the names of the people involved were very difficult to pronounce
sample-012253,i can see the billboards now
sample-012254,an hour later he had before him a chest of spanish gold coins
sample-012255,you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
sample-012256,they inspected the menu at the restaurant
sample-012257,my wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red green and yellow signal lights
sample-012258,but horses tire bit by bit
sample-012259,his name is welch
sample-012260,there was a moment of silence so profound that it seemed the city was asleep
sample-012261,everything you need to know you have learned through your journey
sample-012262,i am already imagining myself at a cafe somewhere far away scribbling away and daydreaming about the past
sample-012263,i have a problem with how you motivate the method
sample-012264,so he asked if the old man's blessing was still with him
sample-012265,how do you think i got here
sample-012266,she would never know the difference because she didn't know how to read
sample-012267,there goes another scrub lady
sample-012268,it occurred to me late last night
sample-012269,he placed urim and thummim in the chest
sample-012270,mostly just the hearts of those who are trying to realize their destinies
sample-012271,and then they want the person to change
sample-012272,we therefore oppose the resolution
sample-012273,you liked the platinum one with the diamonds
sample-012274,it had told him to dig where his tears fell
sample-012275,i thought about whether we should find coins and models in it and so on
sample-012276,don't hurt my sore arm again
sample-012277,and he vanished around the corner of the plaza
sample-012278,it was however still so hot from its flight through the air
sample-012279,pencils down time is over
sample-012280,are you trying to make me out a liar
sample-012281,he knew all the fields and pastures of andalusia
sample-012282,it knew of the boy's talk with the desert because the winds know everything
sample-012283,before the boy could reply a butterfly appeared and fluttered between him and the old man
sample-012284,i thought i'd buy them some groceries
sample-012285,they were on the right track
sample-012286,you've got about two minutes
sample-012287,i have already found my treasure
sample-012288,only a few meters away there is a bus station
sample-012289,the boy had never even noticed that there was a hole in his pouch
sample-012290,three armed tribesmen approached and asked what the boy and the alchemist were doing there
sample-012291,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
sample-012292,he really doesn't look so bad
sample-012293,ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
sample-012294,i'm terribly sorry she isn't here
sample-012295,the tribal chieftain called for the boy and presented him with fifty pieces of gold
sample-012296,they mounted their horses and rode out in the direction of the pyramids of egypt
sample-012297,he had suddenly remembered that in tarifa there was an old woman who interpreted dreams
sample-012298,here i am between my flock and my treasure the boy thought
sample-012299,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
sample-012300,what is it that i still need to know the boy asked
sample-012301,the sea has lived on in this shell because that's its destiny
sample-012302,it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience
sample-012303,this is the first phase of the job he said
sample-012304,the women took turns building a tall stable pile of rocks
sample-012305,enough said the boy
sample-012306,when the blinding dust had settled a bit the boy trembled at what he saw
sample-012307,i used to live near el cairum he said
sample-012308,so it's better to listen to what it has to say
sample-012309,but the tradition also says that we should believe the messages of the desert
sample-012310,the burning fire had been extinguished
sample-012311,where have you been for so long
sample-012312,when you are loved you can do anything in creation
sample-012313,i've already told you
sample-012314,just highlighting that fact in case you overlooked it
sample-012315,someplace you could have put it
sample-012316,she never grew up
sample-012317,they were fascinating stories each of them lived out his destiny to the end
sample-012318,who you holding out on
sample-012319,it drew a droplet of blood
sample-012320,they shouted consolation and promises and went off back to the town again to get help
sample-012321,they voted carlos down
sample-012322,there were mountains in the distance
sample-012323,it was a cobra whose venom could kill a person in minutes
sample-012324,they set off running wildly into the trees
sample-012325,most of them were staring quietly at the big table
sample-012326,i found these one day in the fields
sample-012327,but i felt miserable watching him wither away like a shriveled dandelion
sample-012328,meanwhile the boy thought about his treasure
sample-012329,the end of the cylinder was still as ogilvy and henderson had left it
sample-012330,but he knew that salem wasn't in andalusia
sample-012331,that sobered him a little
sample-012332,but he takes advantage of you
sample-012333,the top had certainly ceased to rotate
sample-012334,the yield is essentially zero
sample-012335,i pointed out mars a bright dot of light
sample-012336,yesterday i waited forever for the subway train
sample-012337,the monk was irritated
sample-012338,i've got to go to him
sample-012339,my agreement with you gentlemen stands
sample-012340,you must love the desert but never trust it completely
sample-012341,we'll find you a hotel
sample-012342,it was his heart that would tell him where his treasure was hidden
sample-012343,he thought of the woman who had trusted in the desert
sample-012344,i finally have enough money and all the time i need
sample-012345,something older than humanity more ancient than the desert
sample-012346,from there he could see africa in the distance
sample-012347,what's all this horseplay about
sample-012350,if we serve tea in crystal the shop is going to expand
sample-012351,the alchemist was a bit daunting but as the boy drank the wine he relaxed
sample-012352,then get out of here
sample-012353,and he gave you that five dollar raise
sample-012354,we're in no hurry the chief answered
sample-012355,there was very little talking
sample-012356,you are almost at the end of your journey said the alchemist
sample-012357,can i get a woot woot
sample-012368,they called it the simum and it was worse than a storm at sea
sample-012369,he was planning as he left the bar
sample-012378,whenever he could he sought out a new road to travel
sample-012379,something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top
sample-012380,revenge is not my style but obviously accidents will happen
sample-012381,do i knock or something
sample-012382,i was just in town earlier this year so it is kind of crazy to think about what took place right after
sample-012383,he recited an our father silently
sample-012384,she doesn't look happy
sample-012385,the boy took out urim and thummim from his bag
sample-012386,but now the sounds inside had stopped
sample-012387,it was a strange furnace fueled by firewood with a transparent flask heating on top
sample-012390,are you sure that joe case is going on next week
sample-012391,he didn't need to demonstrate his science and art to anyone
sample-012392,the descent was disturbingly steep
sample-012393,i'll tell you in a minute
sample-012394,the boy wanted to take her hand
sample-012395,learn to recognize omens and follow them the old king had said
sample-012396,they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
sample-012397,do you want to go to work for me the merchant asked
sample-012408,there were mountains in the distance
sample-012409,i can't remember anything
sample-012418,what are they doing the old man asked pointing at the people in the plaza
sample-012419,but i didnt think that it contained any living creature
sample-012420,the englishman prodded him and the boy asked her about the man who cured people's illnesses
sample-012421,advancing slowly they searched among the stones
sample-012422,doctor kim dressed the wound with a bandage while looking disappointed at me
sample-012423,he thought that with some patience he'd be able to transform everything into gold
sample-012424,i shall make us some ice cubes
sample-012425,take hold of the cover
sample-012426,two horsemen waiting ahead of them
sample-012427,people saw me coming and welcomed me he thought
sample-012430,are you going to let her out
sample-012431,i shall make us some ice cubes
sample-012432,i had to test your courage the stranger said
sample-012433,i shall make us some ice cubes
sample-012434,this time we're going to get it right
sample-012435,you can get around very easily by train  which is a very relaxing and affordable way to travel
sample-012436,you're looking for witch doctors he spoke some verses from the koran and moved on
sample-012437,the top of the cylinder was rotating on its body
sample-012440,life is beautiful
sample-012441,down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
sample-012442,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
sample-012443,he noticed the unequal cooling of its surface
sample-012444,i think maybe you'd better
sample-012445,some of the grey ash was falling off the circular edge
sample-012446,you'd think i was on the witness stand
sample-012447,this desert was once a sea he said
sample-012448,get the riot gear
sample-012449,and eventually man will nourish your sands where the game will once again flourish
sample-012450,i pointed out mars a bright dot of light
sample-012451,and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
sample-012452,you already know about alchemy
sample-012453,i have been waiting for you here at this oasis for a long time
sample-012454,the englishman's eyes lit up
sample-012455,he really doesn't look so bad
sample-012456,they're desperate and will do anything for a cup of coffee
sample-012457,the wind's curiosity was aroused something that had never happened before
sample-012458,can't you just observe men and omens in order to understand the language the boy asked
sample-012459,i hope it works
sample-012460,it sounded like a gypsy prayer
sample-012461,but there's a tribal war the boy reiterated
sample-012462,they forgot that lead copper and iron have their own destinies to fulfill
sample-012463,the englishman vanished too gone to find the alchemist
sample-012464,do you read me
sample-012465,and don't pull that on me neither
sample-012466,you knew the whole story
sample-012467,hires two personal trainers and make one of them train the other one
sample-012468,they're right in there on the desk
sample-012469,then the thing came upon him in a flash
sample-012470,hires two personal trainers and make one of them train the other one
sample-012471,keep trying hard
sample-012472,they dismounted and the alchemist said nothing
sample-012473,never stop dreaming the old king had said
sample-012474,she can't get away
sample-012475,some storms are worth the wreckage
sample-012476,he remembered the sword
sample-012477,they're only made of rock crystal and there are millions of rock crystals in the earth
sample-012478,and i told harry i thought i'd be bored to death
sample-012479,love required them to stay with the people they loved
sample-012480,i'm never more aware of a room's acoustics than when i'm trying to enjoy a snack i have no intention of sharing
sample-012481,he had used the two stones only once one morning when he was at a marketplace
sample-012482,it was glaringly hot not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind
sample-012483,which view would you like
sample-012484,the thought was so dreadful to him that he forgot about the heat and went forward
sample-012485,i guess you're right
sample-012486,he could always become a crystal salesman again
sample-012487,then it became a signal of danger
sample-012488,how did you find out
sample-012489,i'm coming fatima he said
sample-012490,absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
sample-012491,he made us stand and watch him paint for like an hour
sample-012492,i am here the boy said
sample-012493,we must evacuate the courtyard
sample-012494,i want you to be my wife
sample-012495,one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
sample-012496,he believed in omens
sample-012497,because you'll know its dreams and wishes and will know how to deal with them
sample-012498,our clothes are dry
sample-012499,from the railway station in the distance came the sound of trains ringing and rumbling
sample-012500,these sausages are extremely tasty
sample-012501,have a good look
sample-012502,a drought hit western europe
sample-012503,i'm never more aware of a room's acoustics than when i'm trying to enjoy a snack i have no intention of sharing
sample-012504,four hundred and fifty dollars
sample-012505,it was aligned perfectly
sample-012506,down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
sample-012507,is she running a temperature
sample-012508,but the marketplace was empty and he was far from home so he wept
sample-012509,the day was dawning and the shepherd urged his sheep in the direction of the sun
sample-012510,never heard of such a thing
sample-012511,so he began to wander through the city and found himself at the gates
sample-012512,my wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red green and yellow signal lights
sample-012513,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
sample-012514,the alchemist erased the circle in the sand and the snake slithered away among the rocks
sample-012515,henderson stood up with a spade in his hand
sample-012516,the clever men could be ignored
sample-012517,there were just drawings coded instructions and obscure texts
sample-012518,i'm a desert woman and i'm proud of that
sample-012519,what's done is done
sample-012520,it drew a droplet of blood
sample-012521,the night was warm and i was thirsty
sample-012522,one of these days is tomorrow
sample-012523,one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
sample-012524,there is no wine in this country the young man said
sample-012525,that's why i feel that i deserve a part of what you find
sample-012526,are you coming tomorrow
sample-012527,the boy laughed  out of happiness
sample-012528,maybe because that wasn't really his dream
sample-012529,i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
sample-012530,he was thinking about omens and someone had appeared
sample-012531,at the first glance it was really not very exciting
sample-012532,how much is it worth
sample-012533,air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
sample-012534,the men of the desert were already familiar with that wind
sample-012535,several figures approached him
sample-012536,what is my function
sample-012537,two days ago you said that i had never dreamed of travel the merchant answered
sample-012538,and he told what he had seen
sample-012539,then she again took his hands and studied them carefully
sample-012540,sometimes their caravan met with another
sample-012541,but now i'm sad and alone
sample-012542,i just saw the sheriff
sample-012543,he noticed the unequal cooling of its surface
sample-012544,he saw that fatima's eyes were filled with tears
sample-012545,one must prepare for it
sample-012546,he told me i should try to do so
sample-012547,when he reached the top of the dune his heart leapt
sample-012550,it had told him to dig where his tears fell
sample-012551,don't try and lick that pole your tongue will get stuck
sample-012552,he stood irresolute for a moment and then scrambled out of the pit
sample-012553,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
sample-012554,when he's an old man he's going to spend a month in africa
sample-012555,he stood irresolute for a moment and then scrambled out of the pit
sample-012556,this will help you effectively collaborate with developers and coordinate crossteam projects throughout your career
sample-012557,he seemed unfriendly and had looked irritated when the boy had entered
sample-012568,i know very well what you're talking about
sample-012569,a boy came running towards me
sample-012578,but you know that i'm not going to go to mecca
sample-012579,watch out for his venom the boy said
sample-012580,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
sample-012581,so how will we name all these hurricanes
sample-012582,that's true enough the boy thought ruefully
sample-012583,from then on the boy understood his heart
sample-012584,what's for dinner tonight
sample-012585,his eyes filled with tears as he spoke of the prophet
sample-012586,you can read all about it in the newspapers there
sample-012587,what is a foreigner doing here asked another of the men
sample-012590,he had never imagined that questions about life would be of such importance to a shepherd
sample-012591,every day was there to be lived or to mark one's departure from this world
sample-012592,he seemed unfriendly and had looked irritated when the boy had entered
sample-012593,grime rust and residual particles polluted the air
sample-012594,what could i do
sample-012595,the sun began its departure as well
sample-012596,but now the sounds inside had stopped
sample-012597,then he dropped his spade picked up his jacket and came out into the road
sample-012608,that was the law of hospitality
sample-012609,we are part of that soul so we rarely recognize that it is working for us
sample-012618,it's doubled our circulation
sample-012619,there was no need to imprison them the arabs simply confiscated their horses
sample-012620,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
sample-012621,my mind ran on the possibilities of its content
sample-012622,the fumes from the traffic was unbearable
sample-012623,break this crowd up
sample-012624,my tax dollars pay for those public school proms
sample-012625,then she filled her vessel with water and left
sample-012626,that's all i ask
sample-012627,i want to spend christmas in california with my family
sample-012630,this sentence does not make any sense
sample-012631,the camel driver was seated at the base of a palm tree observing the sunset
sample-012632,sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
sample-012633,the englishman's eyes lit up
sample-012634,the streamer of gas came out towards us
sample-012635,the boy smiled to himself
sample-012636,i can't deal with this any more
sample-012637,the snake fought frantically making hissing sounds that shattered the silence of the desert
sample-012640,i won't say anything
sample-012641,he put a sign on the door and they went to a small cafe nearby
sample-012642,the cursor blinked expectantly
sample-012643,the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
sample-012644,the boy promised himself that when he returned from egypt he would buy that sword
sample-012645,i'll do anything you say
sample-012646,how did peter lovelace get that gun
sample-012647,i'm in the pink of condition
sample-012648,from then on he would make his own decisions
sample-012650,the dunes are changed by the wind but the desert never changes
sample-012651,still after that first million before you're thirty
sample-012652,the streamer of gas came out towards us
sample-012653,revenge is not my style but obviously accidents will happen
sample-012654,he didn't want his hand to begin trembling showing the old woman that he was fearful
sample-012655,the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
sample-012656,is your husband with you
sample-012657,i guess you forgot something
sample-012658,the robot was filled with wires and circuit boards
sample-012659,the system with certificate authorities has some serious issues
sample-012660,the thought was so dreadful to him that he forgot about the heat and went forward
sample-012662,i have the diet of a kid who found twenty dollars
sample-012663,but you don't know about love
sample-012664,the alchemist stopped abruptly and bent to the ground
sample-012665,the greatest authority on meteorites stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles
sample-012666,as soon as he saw me among the crowd he called to me to come down
sample-012667,as secretary you can hire anyone you like
sample-012668,the men of the desert were already familiar with that wind
sample-012669,it should provided results comparable to the state of the art
sample-012670,he didn't need to seek out the old woman for this
sample-012671,it's too bad that he's quickly going to forget my name he thought
sample-012672,they never have to make any decisions he thought
sample-012673,is daddy in trouble
sample-012674,the boy thought about the crystal merchant
sample-012676,the stranger withdrew the sword from the boy's forehead and the boy felt immensely relieved
sample-012677,are you going to listen
sample-012678,it was a a kind of fascination that paralysed my actions
sample-012679,it said that the darkest hour of the night came just before the dawn
sample-012680,jim thinks it's morgan
sample-012681,but i was also stumbling because i couldnt look away from these things
sample-012682,sometime during the second year you'll remember about the treasure
sample-012683,why not right here
sample-012684,who do you think writes them
sample-012685,they called it the simum and it was worse than a storm at sea
sample-012686,the gods should not have desires because they don't have destinies
sample-012687,for crying out loud
sample-012688,well then we've got a problem
sample-012689,the insurgents gathered sticks and wood
sample-012690,we've still got two bucks left
sample-012691,but you want to know something
sample-012692,it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-012693,victoria does things in a much bigger way
sample-012694,my tax dollars pay for those public school proms
sample-012695,that day the merchant gave the boy permission to build the display
sample-012696,many people in berkshire surrey and middlesex must have seen it
sample-012697,once you get into the desert there's no going back said the camel driver
sample-012698,a friend had told the boy about the shop and he had taken his sheep there
sample-012699,see if we can move it
sample-012700,at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
sample-012701,to cut to the chase the harvest was really bad
sample-012702,words can hurt very much
sample-012703,he was selling better than ever
sample-012704,she'll see us through dinner
sample-012705,the boy was relieved
sample-012706,he had assumed he would soon return to his sheep
sample-012707,oh they're laughing at me
sample-012708,the volume wouldn't increase much further
sample-012709,you shouldn't be here the alchemist answered
sample-012710,you are almost at the end of your journey said the alchemist
sample-012711,the miner had abandoned everything to go mining for emeralds
sample-012712,they're not concerned with that right now
sample-012713,but i'm going to egypt the boy said
sample-012714,who'd you say was gonna get him
sample-012715,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
sample-012716,i just don't trust anyone who says they've never had hamburger helper
sample-012717,so now i'm a camel driver
sample-012718,he hoped that it would be someone as capable as his previous apprentice
sample-012719,first he had studied esperanto then the world's religions and now it was alchemy
sample-012720,the greatest authority on meteorites stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles
sample-012721,one day the earth began to tremble and the nile overflowed its banks
sample-012722,now it will be with hope
sample-012723,the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
sample-012724,do you know when you're really lonely
sample-012725,it made a faint whistling sound
sample-012726,there was no excuse for goodman to fly off the handle
sample-012727,they said nothing else
sample-012728,you already know about alchemy
sample-012729,where are you from the boy asked
sample-012730,the boy went to his room and packed his belongings
sample-012731,what good is money to you if you're going to die
sample-012732,they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
sample-012733,are you sure there's no mistake
sample-012734,i shall make us some ice cubes
sample-012735,and eventually man will nourish your sands where the game will once again flourish
sample-012736,i was impatient to see it opened
sample-012737,the boy put the stones in his pouch
sample-012738,this is from the governor
sample-012739,the boy reached the small abandoned church just as night was falling
sample-012740,he deleted five tables from the database
sample-012741,it was the pure language of the world
sample-012742,i never saw it before
sample-012743,i've had this shop for thirty years
sample-012744,go and speak to the tribal chieftains said the camel driver
sample-012745,what are you doing here one of the figures demanded
sample-012746,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
sample-012747,worked hard just to have food and water like the sheep
sample-012750,the space was spartan almost bare
sample-012751,one is loved because one is loved
sample-012752,how old are you
sample-012753,i hope it works
sample-012754,canada is quite cold at times
sample-012755,the desert was all sand in some stretches and rocky in others
sample-012756,as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
sample-012757,what are you looking for
sample-012768,it's still sopping wet
sample-012769,the monk was irritated
sample-012778,thailand turned out to be a very satisfying holiday
sample-012779,well he thought about that the old man said
sample-012780,all that time the martians must have been getting ready
sample-012781,he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
sample-012782,i was expecting you
sample-012783,i'm afraid that if my dream is realized i'll have no reason to go on living
sample-012784,they have gotten used to my being away and so have i
sample-012785,i left my father my mother and the town castle behind
sample-012786,he has done so much ghostwriting that he starts to feel like a ghost too
sample-012787,but i didnt think that it contained any living creature
sample-012790,doing a handstand needs a lot of practice to learn
sample-012791,the boy fell to his knees and wept
sample-012792,it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
sample-012793,he really was a king
sample-012794,down at the office we get all the help we want
sample-012795,he brought six sheep with him
sample-012796,my tax dollars pay for those public school proms
sample-012797,are you going to listen
sample-012800,had our instruments permitted it we might have been able to see the trouble way back when
sample-012801,and for wise men gold is the metal that evolved the furthest
sample-012802,you should read the new book mark twain's writing now
sample-012803,the alchemist stopped abruptly and bent to the ground
sample-012804,you knew the whole story
sample-012805,the boy leapt as well but away from the alchemist
sample-012806,the tractor was bearing down hard
sample-012807,your appointment has been changed
sample-012810,there the alchemist separated the disk into four parts
sample-012811,how about that check
sample-012812,there must be somebody there
sample-012813,he decided to return to his friend's stable by the longest route possible
sample-012814,and you've told me about omens
sample-012815,add g love to the this is mozart playlist
sample-012816,i wouldn't take that too seriously
sample-012817,i gotta figure some way out of this thing
sample-012828,and they attacked an empty tent
sample-012829,let's go and have some lunch said the crystal merchant
sample-012838,i finally went by myself and came back this morning feeling happy and refreshed
sample-012839,but children always seem to be able to play with them without frightening them
sample-012840,but only speak a word and my servant will be healed
sample-012841,i understand sheep they're no longer a problem and they can be good friends
sample-012842,it said that the darkest hour of the night came just before the dawn
sample-012843,the tribal chieftains will see that and you'll be dismissed from your position as counselor
sample-012844,we are obliged at least once in our lives to visit the holy city of mecca
sample-012845,he started to read the book he had bought
sample-012847,he experienced the pictures with his fingers while he listened
sample-012848,the boy was startled
sample-012849,then why are you doing it
sample-012850,the boy spent a sleepless night
sample-012851,night fell and an assortment of fighting men and merchants entered and exited the tent
sample-012853,he noticed the unequal cooling of its surface
sample-012854,benjamin repeated the question again but in a commanding way
sample-012855,at the first glance it was really not very exciting
sample-012856,let's the alchemist answered
sample-012857,this will help you effectively collaborate with developers and coordinate crossteam projects throughout your career
sample-012858,he got up early with the idea of finding it
sample-012859,when you are in love things make even more sense he thought
sample-012860,thank heaven you're here
sample-012861,they eat lunch together often but dont really talk outside the office
sample-012862,so how will we name all these hurricanes
sample-012863,the only tribesman spared was the commander of the battalion
sample-012864,the immense collection of people and animals began to travel faster
sample-012865,he's the only husband i've got
sample-012866,i think they're going to last for a long time he said to the monk
sample-012867,who is responsible for these parrots
sample-012868,want to go out on it
sample-012869,i don't want to take any chances
sample-012870,he was dressed only in his pajamas
sample-012871,on the  o'clock train
sample-012872,the omens will begin insistently to speak of it and you'll try to ignore them
sample-012873,the sun thought for a minute
sample-012874,he was tense and upset because he knew that the old man was right
sample-012875,a friend of yours
sample-012876,the stranger placed his sword in its scabbard and the boy relaxed
sample-012877,i didn't need to waste my time just for this he said
sample-012878,i'm not working for any other paper
sample-012879,the forest burned for thirteen days
sample-012880,it seemed as if what the old king had called beginner's luck were no longer functioning
sample-012881,it's the master work of the alchemists
sample-012882,no one said a word as the old man continued
sample-012883,what are these things he asked
sample-012884,yet it was a little too large for assurance
sample-012886,he got up early with the idea of finding it
sample-012887,it had toppled over the brim and fallen into the pit
sample-012888,when the simum ceased to blow everyone looked to the place where the boy had been
sample-012889,that's rather big talk
sample-012890,give me the district attorney's office
sample-012892,the people were also praying to heaven for protection
sample-012893,in his heart he wanted to remain awake but he also wanted to sleep
sample-012894,mostly just the hearts of those who are trying to realize their destinies
sample-012895,everything has been written by the same hand
sample-012896,you will spend that hour getting acquainted with marshall bailey
sample-012897,now i want you to sign this agreement
sample-012898,i'm surprised the boy said
sample-012899,his father said no more
sample-012900,i want you to help me turn myself into the wind the boy answered
sample-012901,but he appeared to be unaware of any danger
sample-012902,i'm just a man who wanders the desert and knows the stars said the alchemist
sample-012903,he paused and his eyes were still unfriendly
sample-012904,without such love one's dreams would have no meaning
sample-012905,the alchemist's words echoed out like a curse
sample-012906,today i understand something i didn't see before every blessing ignored becomes a curse
sample-012907,they're closing in on you
sample-012908,i was scared but wasted no time in going out and crossing the bridge to the sand pits
sample-012909,i've crossed these sands many times said one of the camel drivers one night
sample-012910,love is the force that transforms and improves the soul of the world
sample-012911,christmas is a lot like easter
sample-012912,if i could i'd write a huge encyclopedia just about the words luck and coincidence
sample-012913,in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
sample-012914,you are almost at the end of your journey said the alchemist
sample-012915,so how will we name all these hurricanes
sample-012916,hey dj play the top one hundred tracks
sample-012917,where's ashley's wallet
sample-012918,at the first glance it was really not very exciting
sample-012919,that's the magic of omens said the boy
sample-012920,the brake fluid was leaking out onto the path
sample-012921,on the following day the first clear sign of danger appeared
sample-012922,at that point in their lives everything is clear and everything is possible
sample-012923,i don't trust anybody
sample-012924,the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
sample-012925,will you give me your blessing asked the boy
sample-012926,i didn't know whose it was
sample-012927,even then he hardly understood what this meant
sample-012928,he noticed the unequal cooling of its surface
sample-012929,too bad he has to be fed on a bottle
sample-012930,another dreamer said the ticket seller to his assistant watching the boy walk away
sample-012931,can i get a woot woot
sample-012932,i asked him to let me use the kitchen for a while the alchemist smiled
sample-012933,all i saw was an army said the boy
sample-012934,there was an accident at work a camel stampede nearly killed the janitor
sample-012935,everything in the universe evolved he said
sample-012936,jill caught the ball that peter had thrown towards her
sample-012937,that sobered him a little
sample-012938,the whole creature heaved and pulsated convulsively
sample-012939,the streamer of gas came out towards us
sample-012948,as an approximation we use a multivariate gaussian distribution
sample-012949,i promised that i would make my own decisions he said to himself
sample-012958,putting a pool under this floor was a great idea
sample-012959,but those who know about such things would know that those are urim and thummim
sample-012960,and the murmur lasted longer than a simple vow would have
sample-012961,you may not have a great deal of time
sample-012962,sometimes i appear in the form of a solution or a good idea
sample-012963,that night he told all of this to the alchemist
sample-012964,another dreamer said the ticket seller to his assistant watching the boy walk away
sample-012965,at the first glance it was really not very exciting
sample-012966,he felt uneasy at the man's presence
sample-012967,what did your family have to say about it
sample-012970,then he dropped his spade picked up his jacket and came out into the road
sample-012971,the night was warm and i was thirsty
sample-012972,he approached the mass and was surprised at the size and the shape
sample-012973,i shall make us some ice cubes
sample-012974,i'm afraid that if my dream is realized i'll have no reason to go on living
sample-012975,i'm afraid you're blocking my view
sample-012976,i wanted to sleep a little longer he thought
sample-012977,they're not concerned with that right now
sample-012988,he had never imagined that questions about life would be of such importance to a shepherd
sample-012989,they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
sample-012998,if he makes a buying mistake it doesn't affect him much
sample-012999,put down that chair
sample-013000,it's a simple story
sample-013001,now i will drift gently off to dreamland
sample-013002,he called to the boy and they took a walk along the dunes surrounding the encampment
sample-013003,that day the merchant gave the boy permission to build the display
sample-013004,the window opened outward
sample-013005,the plastic barrier shattered
sample-013006,the stranger withdrew the sword from the boy's forehead and the boy felt immensely relieved
sample-013007,another trick the boy thought
sample-013008,the quicker the better
sample-013009,he employed the most cunning of tactics
sample-013010,have a good look
sample-013011,the levanter was still getting stronger and he felt its force on his face
sample-013012,but they don't count
sample-013013,and we had a bite
sample-013014,she will also announce the third party's candidate for the presidency
sample-013015,replace the ts in tim tebow's name with any other consonant to get a star wars character
sample-013016,where are you bound asked the young arab
sample-013017,has he been here
sample-013018,so then try he said to the englishman
sample-013019,the top of the cylinder was rotating on its body
sample-013020,i pointed out mars a bright dot of light
sample-013021,looking up he saw a pair of hawks flying high in the sky
sample-013022,once you get into the desert there's no going back said the camel driver
sample-013023,and now it was only four days before he would be back in that same village
sample-013024,it was a pleasant change from talking to his sheep
sample-013025,it's true life really is generous to those who pursue their destiny the boy thought
sample-013026,imagine if everyone went around transforming lead into gold
sample-013027,so how will we name all these hurricanes
sample-013028,that life may always have flavor
sample-013029,why did we have to have all these kids
sample-013030,then the thing came upon him in a flash
sample-013031,how can you tell
sample-013032,well why don't you go to mecca now asked the boy
sample-013033,they were given to me as a present by a king the boy said
sample-013034,when he reached the top of the dune his heart leapt
sample-013035,before him was an enormous white horse rearing over him with a frightening scream
sample-013036,if i'm on the march i just concentrate on marching
sample-013037,it made a faint whistling sound
sample-013038,down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
sample-013039,there was a forest fire in los angeles
sample-013048,but there's a tribal war the boy reiterated
sample-013049,it's not my house
sample-013058,but we could sell tea in crystal glasses
sample-013059,they were fascinating stories each of them lived out his destiny to the end
sample-013060,as the sun rose the men began to beat the boy
sample-013061,he fell asleep and when he awoke the sun was already high
sample-013062,she loves to get up early
sample-013063,there were mountains in the distance
sample-013064,of course there is
sample-013065,and you know it
sample-013066,there's no time like the present
sample-013067,my mind ran on the possibilities of its content
sample-013070,the englishman was disappointed
sample-013071,i want to talk to you
sample-013072,but the boy was quiet
sample-013073,we don't know what's in the confounded thing do you
sample-013074,suddenly for no apparent reason the boy's horse began to slow
sample-013075,the alchemist followed as the boy's horse ran for almost half an hour
sample-013076,he arose and taking up his crook began to awaken the sheep that still slept
sample-013077,i shall make us some ice cubes
sample-013088,i think somebody stole one of his crown jewels
sample-013089,if what one finds is made of pure matter it will never spoil
sample-013098,i'm on the job
sample-013099,because i don't live in either my past or my future
sample-013100,my tax dollars pay for those public school proms
sample-013101,i guess i'm just upset about all this
sample-013102,what's from the governor
sample-013103,but his heart was speaking of other things
sample-013104,at once he connected the two incidents
sample-013105,drink and enjoy yourself said the alchemist noticing that the boy was feeling happier
sample-013106,his death is registered with the war department in washington
sample-013107,a long note was sounded on a bugle and everyone mounted up
sample-013110,merry christmas my dears
sample-013111,maybe we can wait a little bit before changing the titles and the text everywhere else
sample-013112,i saw a young man standing on the cylinder and trying to scramble out of the hole again
sample-013113,are you trying to make me out a liar
sample-013114,bakers have homes while shepherds sleep out in the open
sample-013115,at once he connected the two incidents
sample-013116,if he makes a buying mistake it doesn't affect him much
sample-013117,i'm leaving today said the boy
sample-013128,i'm sure this gate was locked the last time i checked
sample-013129,an alchemist said the alchemist
sample-013138,can i get a woot woot
sample-013139,it's not easy to find the philosopher's stone said the englishman
sample-013140,the alchemist is two hundred years old the englishman had told him
sample-013141,the treasure is at the pyramids that you already knew
sample-013142,it was starlight and i explained the signs of the zodiac to her
sample-013143,it was a useful reminder to complete the task
sample-013144,but the alchemist continued to look to the horizon
sample-013145,you'd better get dressed
sample-013146,but they really don't know what they're saying
sample-013147,you dominated those horsemen with the way you looked at them he said
sample-013148,he wanted to forget about the vision and return to his meditation
sample-013149,but before i go i want to tell you a little story
sample-013150,it's what you have always wanted to accomplish
sample-013151,he rose and made his way back toward the palm trees
sample-013152,they can't even find him
sample-013153,let me see it
sample-013154,someplace you could have put it
sample-013155,people saw me coming and welcomed me he thought
sample-013156,he has done so much ghostwriting that he starts to feel like a ghost too
sample-013157,it was impossible to remember all the details that he covered in an hour
sample-013158,and at that i told him and he took my place
sample-013159,my seven year resume gap is marked not drugs
sample-013160,at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
sample-013161,bert the cop was wounded in north africa
sample-013162,but most important he was able every day to live out his dream
sample-013163,now what's the story
sample-013164,i heard a faint movement under my feet
sample-013165,the angel touched the man's shoulder and they were both projected far into the future
sample-013166,but his heart was speaking of other things
sample-013167,because life wants you to achieve your destiny
sample-013168,henderson was taking it in
sample-013169,we had to rush down the minute it happened
sample-013170,she finds the world has feet of clay
sample-013171,then taking his sheep he walked away
sample-013172,now i will drift gently off to dreamland
sample-013173,what's going on in there
sample-013174,he believed in omens
sample-013175,they become the soul o f the world
sample-013176,the alchemist dismounted and told the escorts they could return to the camp
sample-013177,and i think it's terrific
sample-013178,the newspaper articles had prepared everyone for the reception of the idea
sample-013179,i feel fine now
sample-013180,after all who doesnt want to overcome new challenges and achieve great heights
sample-013181,it was the devil
sample-013182,he told me i should try to do so
sample-013183,the boy felt a pang in his heart thinking about the merchant's daughter
sample-013184,how much do you want on it
sample-013185,some went away while i was there and other people came
sample-013186,just what is the lowdown on williams
sample-013187,before him was an enormous white horse rearing over him with a frightening scream
sample-013188,he lives at the alfayoum oasis his friend had said
sample-013189,i knew if i were drowning you'd try to save me
sample-013190,it had toppled over the brim and fallen into the pit
sample-013191,i want you to be my wife
sample-013192,and i'd like to have it
sample-013193,was it my fault
sample-013194,you're looking for witch doctors he spoke some verses from the koran and moved on
sample-013195,what'd you wish when you threw that rock
sample-013196,you hit my best friend
sample-013197,makes about five thousand a year
sample-013198,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
sample-013199,the arab accepted them without a word
sample-013200,all they ever do really is look for food and water
sample-013201,the next day the boy met the old man at noon
sample-013202,so what is salem like he asked trying to get some sort of clue
sample-013203,that song reminds me of my childhood
sample-013204,strange images passed through my mind
sample-013205,make room for mrs chelsea
sample-013206,i want my husband to wander as free as the wind that shapes the dunes
sample-013207,what does snow smell like
sample-013208,the atmosphere was suffused with the sweet scent of smoke
sample-013209,the englishman prodded him and the boy asked her about the man who cured people's illnesses
sample-013210,one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
sample-013211,on the first day he returned with a rabbit and on the second with two birds
sample-013212,and one or two persons were returning
sample-013213,there were really i think two or three hundred people elbowing one another
sample-013214,petrov made a funny face as he turned
sample-013215,i own my own house
sample-013216,my seven year resume gap is marked not drugs
sample-013217,it's what you have always wanted to accomplish
sample-013218,it seemed so safe and tranquil
sample-013220,it's extremely suspicious that there's no information about brains that didn't come from a brain
sample-013221,drawing from my own experience as a learner of english and german i value engaging activities that involve everyday conversation
sample-013222,you should see the other guy specifically how good at fighting he is
sample-013223,i couldn't go through another day like this
sample-013224,he thought of the woman who had trusted in the desert
sample-013226,and then he perceived it very slowly
sample-013227,he doesn't have anything else
sample-013228,he remembered the sword
sample-013229,when the sun sets the men will once again surrender their arms to me
sample-013230,a large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered
sample-013232,the soul of the world is nourished by people's happiness
sample-013233,he's already killed three men
sample-013234,then what am i doing here
sample-013235,they jumped out of the window
sample-013236,and at that i told him and he took my place
sample-013237,it would have been visible to me had i only looked up as it passed
sample-013238,a home with father
sample-013239,but they were not there
sample-013248,just as your grandfather taught you
sample-013249,jane spoke emphatically
sample-013258,tangier is not like the rest of africa
sample-013259,she just called me
sample-013260,for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
sample-013261,and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
sample-013262,the merchant looked anxiously at the boy
sample-013263,that sobered him a little
sample-013264,i have the diet of a kid who found twenty dollars
sample-013265,but the boy was quiet
sample-013266,what were you going to write about hillary
sample-013267,it always helps to be learning something new and exciting
sample-013270,this man's going to jump as a matter of principle
sample-013271,we're going to shoot the works
sample-013272,the boy was surprised
sample-013273,they never found the secret
sample-013274,coming home a party of tourists passed us singing and playing music
sample-013275,after two hours he returned to the room where the wise man was
sample-013276,it's a terrible reflection on our city
sample-013277,it was faintly marked with transverse stripes and slightly flattened from the perfect round
sample-013288,the stranger was speaking of things that very few people knew about
sample-013289,isn't it all too wonderful
sample-013298,angela wanted to copy everything he had done
sample-013299,you ought to stay over
sample-013300,first they tried to find him on their own
sample-013301,and one or two persons were returning
sample-013302,i sold crystal and crossed the desert
sample-013303,so the wind blew with all its strength and the sky was filled with sand
sample-013304,a large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered
sample-013305,where's mrs luke's box of capsules
sample-013306,you're worth more dead than alive
sample-013307,casper predicted the outcome
sample-013310,but now the sounds inside had stopped
sample-013311,i'm not going to charge you anything now she said
sample-013312,it had told him to dig where his tears fell
sample-013313,the nearby city of ceuta had grown faster than tangier and business had fallen off
sample-013314,many of them had been right about what they said while some had been wrong
sample-013315,at the camp it was difficult to see anything
sample-013316,i had never heard of alchemists before the boy said
sample-013317,the sun was setting when the boy's heart sounded a danger signal
sample-013328,we'll get you out in ten minutes
sample-013329,and also by unhappiness envy and jealousy
sample-013338,help my friend mr richard
sample-013339,it was a great relief
sample-013340,at that point the omens will tell you that your treasure is buried forever
sample-013341,am i going to find my treasure he asked
sample-013342,you should see the other guy specifically how good at fighting he is
sample-013343,this man's going to jump off a roof
sample-013344,then the thing came upon him in a flash
sample-013345,well then why did you let me do it the boy asked
sample-013346,i had seen all that it would presently bring me
sample-013347,the sun was setting when the boy's heart sounded a danger signal
sample-013348,you don't think i'm gonna tell
sample-013349,the desert fills men's hearts with visions the camel driver answered
sample-013350,and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
sample-013351,johnathan assessed the situation carefully
sample-013352,he noticed the unequal cooling of its surface
sample-013353,then he turned to the boy this time his expression was cold and distant
sample-013354,he had seen the shooting star and was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere nearby
sample-013355,me and a friend of mine
sample-013356,you'd lie about anything
sample-013357,his hands were abraded and exhausted but he listened to his heart
sample-013358,but he knew that salem wasn't in andalusia
sample-013359,but you are in the desert
sample-013360,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
sample-013361,goodbye said the boy
sample-013362,well then stand up
sample-013363,the burning fire had been extinguished
sample-013364,anthony kept himself busy by counting pigeons
sample-013365,at the first glance it was really not very exciting
sample-013366,my mind ran on the possibilities of its content
sample-013367,because you have already lost your savings twice
sample-013368,from that day on the oasis would be an empty place for her
sample-013369,he took urim and thummim from his pocket and began playing with them
sample-013370,no the alchemist answered
sample-013371,lots of shepherds passed through selling their wool
sample-013372,they spoke about mercury salt dragons and kings and he didn't understand any of it
sample-013373,i wonder what's eating that old money grubbing buzzard anyway
sample-013374,the boy was relieved
sample-013375,he walked slowly through the market
sample-013376,how would you like a punch in the nose
sample-013377,you have a mania for simplifying everything answered the englishman irritated
sample-013378,it spoke of journeys discoveries books and change
sample-013379,i have a warm feeling for my pair of dogwalkers
sample-013380,the tea seemed less bitter
sample-013381,most of them were staring quietly at the big table
sample-013382,the boy repeated his question
sample-013383,i'll go right after it
sample-013384,he had studied latin spanish and theology
sample-013385,we'll make a mystery out of him
sample-013386,am i going to find my treasure he asked
sample-013387,but it is not a class that was requested by our alumni or prospective students
sample-013388,who are you he heard a voice ask him in spanish
sample-013389,so you combined pleasure with business
sample-013390,i suppose i could
sample-013391,you must not let up even after having come so far he continued
sample-013392,the panels lined the roofs of the suburban homes generating the energy to power the future
sample-013393,i tell you that it's no good
sample-013394,there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
sample-013395,but i'd like to see the castles in the towns where they live the boy explained
sample-013396,the other son was a poet and delighted all of rome with his beautiful verses
sample-013397,a large piece suddenly came off and fell with a loud and sharp noise
sample-013398,there's been too much talk going on in this world
sample-013399,storm increasing over the rockies
sample-013400,i read only what the birds wanted to tell me
sample-013401,i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
sample-013402,at the first glance it was really not very exciting
sample-013403,just handling them made him feel better
sample-013404,we've got to do something
sample-013405,the old man returned the book to the boy
sample-013406,it was something that i thought could happen only to others never to me
sample-013407,a registration process is required
sample-013408,what is it about
sample-013409,they called that discovery the master work  it was part liquid and part solid
sample-013410,the boy began to dig into the dune
sample-013411,for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
sample-013412,people should spend time on improving opensource projects instead of helping market dominating companies
sample-013413,the alchemist removed the pan from the fire and set it aside to cool
sample-013414,fatima is a woman of the desert said the alchemist
sample-013415,only we call them agents
sample-013416,i'm going to put her through college
sample-013417,this morning i found a calculator taped to my wii
sample-013418,then it became a signal of danger
sample-013419,it was a mega monster made of metal
sample-013420,pink foam floated gently through the air landing on the parked vehicles
sample-013421,stick to your clubs
sample-013422,what did he buy a paper for
sample-013423,as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
sample-013424,the night was warm and i was thirsty
sample-013425,it is the most valuable stamp in the world
sample-013426,henderson was taking it in
sample-013427,go and speak to the tribal chieftains said the camel driver
sample-013428,did you learn anything the englishman asked eager to hear what it might be
sample-013429,the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
sample-013430,take her to the hospital
sample-013431,we don't know when the war will end so we can't continue our journey he said
sample-013432,will you give me your blessing asked the boy
sample-013433,don't worry about him he'll be fine
sample-013434,it was something that i thought could happen only to others never to me
sample-013435,he followed the movement of the birds trying to read something into it
sample-013436,she awoke from the nightmare
sample-013437,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
sample-013438,a boy came running towards me
sample-013439,the one you're blocking
sample-013448,but i'm going in search of my treasure the boy said
sample-013449,the young arab took out a book and began to read
sample-013458,what difference does it make what time it is
sample-013459,three to two in our favor
sample-013460,nature knows me as the wisest being in creation the sun said
sample-013461,if it were he would already have heard of it
sample-013462,looking through the telescope i saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet
sample-013463,then she again took his hands and studied them carefully
sample-013464,now it will be with hope
sample-013465,i should thank you
sample-013466,in those times the master work could be written simply on an emerald
sample-013467,you like every boy
sample-013470,i was impatient to see it opened
sample-013471,he just got a new kite for his birthday
sample-013472,you wanna take this outside
sample-013473,you don't know scott
sample-013474,the boy climbed the dune slowly
sample-013475,i'd like to build a display case for the crystal the boy said to the merchant
sample-013476,my phone is in my back pocket
sample-013477,the men climbed the hill and they were tired when they reached the top
sample-013488,what is it you're looking for asked the old merchant
sample-013489,i thought about whether we should find coins and models in it and so on
sample-013498,who's got the room next to hers
sample-013499,then one day the boy returned the books to the englishman
sample-013500,the boy didn't say anything
sample-013501,no sense in going up there
sample-013502,maybe we're all that way the boy mused
sample-013503,but they were not there
sample-013504,a card hanging in the doorway announced that several languages were spoken in the shop
sample-013505,the streamer of gas came out towards us
sample-013506,i had to test your courage the stranger said
sample-013507,he got up early with the idea of finding it
sample-013510,i've got to talk to you straight from the shoulder
sample-013511,an huge hole had been made by the impact of the projectile
sample-013512,why should it be awkward
sample-013513,it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
sample-013514,i'd like you to take me there if you can
sample-013515,the boy watched the exchange with fascination
sample-013516,it doesn't matter he said to his sheep
sample-013517,the englishman said nothing
sample-013528,he knelt down to find urim and thummim and put them back in the pouch
sample-013529,and then there were the others who were interested only in gold
sample-013538,but there was something there in his heart that wouldn't allow him to do so
sample-013539,not everyone can see his dreams come true in the same way
sample-013540,and in that mood he was grateful to be in love
sample-013541,all i saw was an army said the boy
sample-013542,i swear it on my mother's grave
sample-013544,you knew the whole story
sample-013545,men have never understood the words of the wise
sample-013546,vibrations of peace throughout the tent
sample-013547,when i returned to the common the sun was setting
sample-013548,the sun was turned into a golden disk
sample-013549,i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
sample-013550,it doesn't matter he said to his sheep
sample-013551,you could run an interview that would prove it
sample-013552,but i'm going in search of my treasure the boy said
sample-013553,are you going to go to julia's
sample-013554,i saw the shopkeeper struggling near the edge of the pit
sample-013555,i can clean up those glasses in the window if you want said the boy
sample-013556,show me some gratitude
sample-013558,i can see that right now
sample-013559,what are you talking about
sample-013560,the jacket had a purpose and so did the boy
sample-013561,but he takes advantage of you
sample-013562,i can only tell you what i saw
sample-013563,maktub the boy said remembering the crystal merchant
sample-013564,i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
sample-013565,i'm not afraid of failing
sample-013566,then he realized that he had been distracted for a few moments looking at the sword
sample-013567,but if you can try to make your own decisions
sample-013568,i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
sample-013569,the dead soldiers were replaced by others and life went on
sample-013570,we don't know what's in the confounded thing do you
sample-013571,people saw me coming and welcomed me he thought
sample-013572,the boy and the englishman had bought camels and climbed uncertainly onto their backs
sample-013573,as quick as that
sample-013574,i've already told you
sample-013575,replace the ts in tim tebow's name with any other consonant to get a star wars character
sample-013576,when the sun sets the men will once again surrender their arms to me
sample-013577,i had the everyone has gary busey's teeth dream again
sample-013578,i'm an old superstitious arab and i believe in our proverbs
sample-013579,then suddenly he noticed it with a start
sample-013581,my wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red green and yellow signal lights
sample-013582,they went on smoking the pipe for a while as the sun began to set
sample-013583,the boy thought it a strange question
sample-013584,replace the ts in tim tebow's name with any other consonant to get a star wars character
sample-013585,a new movie is shown the first time in cinema
sample-013586,there were raised voicesand some sort of struggle appeared to be going on 
sample-013587,my husband revealed he was homosexual
sample-013588,he had come to the town only to find a woman who could interpret his dream
sample-013589,since the miner had sacrificed everything to his destiny the old man decided to become involved
sample-013590,why the shots stopped after the tenth no one on earth has tried to explain
sample-013591,the diver forced open the oyster revealing a shimmering pearl
sample-013592,the idea frightened him
sample-013593,isn't the party also to announce his engagement to joanna
sample-013595,what am i doing
sample-013596,but i found it difficult to get to work because of the investigations
sample-013597,give me that call on patrick's wire
sample-013598,the boy wanted to believe that his friend had simply become separated from him by accident
sample-013599,but you know that i'm not going to go to mecca
sample-013600,you already know all you need to know
sample-013601,his arm seemed to be battling with whatever was in the hole
sample-013602,in one he had read that many years ago a famous arabian alchemist had visited europe
sample-013603,i wish they were too
sample-013604,he's an immigrant from portugal
sample-013605,when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
sample-013606,can't you understand that
sample-013607,i never said i'd take it
sample-013608,i'm coming fatima he said
sample-013609,the englishman prodded him and the boy asked her about the man who cured people's illnesses
sample-013610,there are powerful forces on both sides and the war is important to both armies
sample-013611,ten minutes ago i had a job
sample-013612,christmas eve at midnight
sample-013613,it was unforgivable and unexplainable
sample-013614,it's even higher than this
sample-013615,i can't get hold of him
sample-013616,he couldn't have been wrong
sample-013617,i need a drink
sample-013618,from a technical point of view the mpstandard is completely outdated and yet it's still very successful
sample-013619,but my heart is agitated the boy said
sample-013620,it was a tent like many at the oasis
sample-013621,strange images passed through my mind
sample-013622,why'd you want to save me
sample-013623,no he's loyal
sample-013624,she cried for an hour
sample-013625,who are these people
sample-013626,replace the ts in tim tebow's name with any other consonant to get a star wars character
sample-013627,on his hands and knees
sample-013628,nice of you to come down
sample-013629,the caravan moved toward the east
sample-013630,the big charleston contest
sample-013631,had our instruments permitted it we might have been able to see the trouble way back when
sample-013632,pierre decided to research gay culture
sample-013633,and i will tell you how to find the hidden treasure
sample-013634,it was the first time she had done that
sample-013635,it's true life really is generous to those who pursue their destiny the boy thought
sample-013636,servants came and went with silver trays laden with spices and tea
sample-013637,sure i know where she lives
sample-013638,and will we do things
sample-013639,and he wasn't faring much better
sample-013648,always ask an objective question
sample-013649,like everybody learns he said
sample-013658,you can have as many babies as you like
sample-013659,life attracts life the alchemist answered
sample-013660,it was difficult not to think about what he had left behind
sample-013661,a boy came running towards me
sample-013662,a shepherd may like to travel but he should never forget about his sheep
sample-013663,i'll see that she gets the flowers
sample-013664,everyone when they are young knows what their destiny is
sample-013665,we're all excited around here
sample-013666,an huge hole had been made by the impact of the projectile
sample-013667,i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
sample-013670,at once he connected the two incidents
sample-013671,kidneys are transplanted often because every healthy person has two of them
sample-013672,i used to live near el cairum he said
sample-013673,the boy wanted to take her hand
sample-013674,yours sincerely satan
sample-013675,what are these things he asked
sample-013676,he's doing it because it's what he wants to do
sample-013677,nobody knows where she got it
sample-013688,whatever the thing observed one could find a connection with his experience of the moment
sample-013689,it was an oblong shape
sample-013698,i'll give you three minutes to tell me where she is
sample-013699,it must have fallen while i was sitting over there
sample-013700,but it is not a class that was requested by our alumni or prospective students
sample-013701,dense clouds of smoke or dust can be seen through a powerful telescope
sample-013702,because now he knew where his treasure was
sample-013703,i'm proud of you
sample-013704,somehow the purple colour faded to gray
sample-013705,they play duets together
sample-013706,you old sorcerer the boy shouted up to the sky
sample-013707,but if you can try to make your own decisions
sample-013710,they can't do that to me
sample-013711,the burning fire had been extinguished
sample-013712,they can't do that to me
sample-013713,and if you improve on the present what comes later will also be better
sample-013714,i pointed out mars a bright dot of light
sample-013715,before long maybe in just a few days he would be at the pyramids
sample-013716,she retired to a big comfy couch in the corner of the hall
sample-013717,because he knew what he would find
sample-013728,and he decided he would go to see the chiefs of the tribes
sample-013729,treason is a blow that comes unexpectedly
sample-013738,i just got an email from my crush
sample-013739,i don't know why i came here in the first place
sample-013740,and this is your coat
sample-013741,it's the oasis said the camel driver
sample-013742,the sun shines so brightly
sample-013743,you're here rather early
sample-013744,we miss you and miss having a friend like you and i am so happy that you two got to catch up
sample-013745,in symmetric cryptography the same key is used for encryption and decryption
sample-013746,the population was increasing exponentially
sample-013747,i'm going to find that damned alchemist the englishman thought
sample-013748,a young arab also loaded down with baggage entered and greeted the englishman
sample-013749,the crowd swayed a little as i elbowed my way through
sample-013750,there are powerful forces on both sides and the war is important to both armies
sample-013751,he told me i should try to do so
sample-013752,it is always nice to hear that your presence is appreciated
sample-013753,the idea frightened him
sample-013754,if you start your emails with greetings let me be the first to welcome you to earth
sample-013755,there are no words to describe how difficult that day was
sample-013756,when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
sample-013757,when i returned to the common the sun was setting
sample-013758,pay and spray stay and pray play and sway what did you say
sample-013759,i wished i had a light to smoke by
sample-013760,that sobered him a little
sample-013761,well then help me do that the boy said
sample-013762,my father offered her a job
sample-013763,maybe that's why they always stay close to me
sample-013764,take your paws off me
sample-013765,maybe we'd better ask someone the boy suggested
sample-013766,the miner had abandoned everything to go mining for emeralds
sample-013767,send those other people in
sample-013768,you've got to do something
sample-013769,the boy was surprised at his thoughts
sample-013770,taking the jacket out he began to clean the glasses
sample-013771,so that those who have the responsibility for understanding can understand he said
sample-013772,we'll have something to drink and eat these hawks
sample-013773,help me the boy said
sample-013774,the alchemist removed the pan from the fire and set it aside to cool
sample-013775,he had done this for years and knew the schedule of everyone who passed
sample-013776,but he kept the sword in his hand
sample-013777,people from all over the world have passed through this village son said his father
sample-013778,it's because you were not born
sample-013779,tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself
sample-013780,here's the picture of my wife
sample-013781,it's a temporary tattoo that looks like a color wheel
sample-013782,you could have died after peace had been declared
sample-013783,the boy was relieved
sample-013784,there was very little talking
sample-013785,that was his work
sample-013786,the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
sample-013787,it is the most valuable stamp in the world
sample-013788,there was a murmur from the crowd
sample-013789,the boy swore that every time he heard the alarm he would heed its message
sample-013790,from the railway station in the distance came the sound of trains ringing and rumbling
sample-013791,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
sample-013792,the jacket had a purpose and so did the boy
sample-013793,they didn't have the printing press in those days the boy argued
sample-013794,i'm so hungry i could faint
sample-013795,the day was hot and the wine was refreshing
sample-013796,but he appeared to be unaware of any danger
sample-013797,isn't it a little crowded
sample-013798,after the dictator's rule of fourty three years was over the country was devastated
sample-013799,if you pay attention to the present you can improve upon it
sample-013800,and he knew what was the fair price for every one of his animals
sample-013801,have you got the speech i gave you
sample-013802,he knew he was stronger than his friend
sample-013803,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
sample-013804,he had seen the shooting star and was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere nearby
sample-013805,i have been wanting to go and waiting for him to go with me
sample-013806,then a man approached
sample-013807,you are almost at the end of your journey said the alchemist
sample-013808,there's a caravan leaving today for alfayoum
sample-013809,i have already found my treasure
sample-013810,down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
sample-013811,it was starlight and i explained the signs of the zodiac to her
sample-013812,he is going to transform himself into the wind just to demonstrate his powers
sample-013813,what do you want here today the desert asked him
sample-013814,but you will love her and she'll return your love
sample-013815,but one of them seized the boy and yanked him back out of the hole
sample-013816,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
sample-013817,the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
sample-013818,it was faintly marked with transverse stripes and slightly flattened from the perfect round
sample-013819,the boy knew the desert sensed his fear
sample-013820,give me my robe
sample-013821,coming home a party of tourists passed us singing and playing music
sample-013822,i'm trying to explain to my mother how to get pictures off her phone
sample-013823,they represent millions of voters
sample-013824,the boy was getting irritated
sample-013825,the omens had told him so
sample-013826,promise you'll never lie the way snoopy did
sample-013827,sorry the test period expired
sample-013828,no one seemed to have thought about it that night
sample-013829,looking through the telescope i saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet
sample-013830,every image processing software contains automatic contrast and color enhancement
sample-013831,how do i guess at the future
sample-013832,sometimes i appear in the form of a solution or a good idea
sample-013833,its lower end was still embedded
sample-013834,the tea seemed less bitter
sample-013835,they crossed the desert for another two days in silence
sample-013836,i don't want any plastics
sample-013837,a steel framed table separated one half of the room from the other
sample-013838,he had seen the shooting star and was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere nearby
sample-013839,i'll kill both of them
sample-013840,you'll use your knowledge for the welfare of the oasis and its inhabitants
sample-013841,he reached over and picked up a shell from the ground
sample-013842,don't worry about that
sample-013843,it was the pure language of the world
sample-013844,a current of love rushed from his heart and the boy began to pray
sample-013845,you'll watch them as they grow demonstrating how the world is always changing
sample-013846,it was impossible to remember all the details that he covered in an hour
sample-013847,at the first glance it was really not very exciting
sample-013850,the treasure is at the pyramids that you already knew
sample-013851,he paid for the wool and asked the shepherd to come back the following year
sample-013852,but they were not there
sample-013853,how did you learn to read the girl asked at one point
sample-013854,the woman said she had never heard of such a person and hurried away
sample-013855,i'm going to build skyscrapers a hundred stories high
sample-013856,we're looking at it right now
sample-013857,but he didn't need to worry about that right now
sample-013868,and they found the watch on him
sample-013869,the heather was on fire and you could see a thin blue smoke rising up slowly
sample-013878,they didn't have the printing press in those days the boy argued
sample-013879,he was older and was carrying a small bucket
sample-013880,i'm a desert woman and i'm proud of that
sample-013881,the angel touched the man's shoulder and they were both projected far into the future
sample-013882,it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-013883,in those times the master work could be written simply on an emerald
sample-013884,sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
sample-013885,want to walk to new york
sample-013886,fatima was more important than his treasure
sample-013887,he arose and taking up his crook began to awaken the sheep that still slept
sample-013890,i've actually fallen in love with him
sample-013891,i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
sample-013892,why the shots stopped after the tenth no one on earth has tried to explain
sample-013893,i waited all afternoon and evening he said
sample-013894,and at that i told him and he took my place
sample-013895,the conversation was interrupted by the warehouse boss
sample-013896,don't try to move
sample-013897,based on the omens of the present
sample-013908,he got up early with the idea of finding it
sample-013909,strange images passed through my mind
sample-013918,he moved about invisible but everyone could hear him
sample-013919,the boy said nothing
sample-013920,he told me i should try to do so
sample-013921,her father's awful worried about her
sample-013922,what good is money to you if you're going to die
sample-013923,but that's what they gave me
sample-013924,in order to find the treasure you will have to follow the omens
sample-013925,he told me i should try to do so
sample-013926,a shepherd may like to travel but he should never forget about his sheep
sample-013927,it was flowering beautifully
sample-013930,you came so that you could learn about your dreams said the old woman
sample-013931,pierre decided to research gay culture
sample-013932,maybe these desert birds could explain to him the meaning of love without ownership
sample-013933,with the girl with the raven hair his days would never be the same again
sample-013934,it took him a while to get to the office
sample-013935,we therefore oppose the resolution
sample-013936,the merchant turned to a customer who wanted three crystal glasses
sample-013937,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
sample-013940,but that was simply because my eye was tired
sample-013941,they can't even find him
sample-013942,i'll do anything you say
sample-013943,an appeal to john doe
sample-013944,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
sample-013945,i heard what you were talking about the other day with the alchemist the wind said
sample-013946,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
sample-013947,is this your wife's passport
sample-013948,the boy wanted to take her hand
sample-013949,should i understand the emerald tablet the boy asked
sample-013950,i don't care what happens to me
sample-013951,the old man wore a breastplate of heavy gold covered with precious stones
sample-013952,but he'd have to
sample-013953,a friend had told the boy about the shop and he had taken his sheep there
sample-013954,then suddenly he noticed it with a start
sample-013955,i need one more
sample-013956,we couldn't find the high street
sample-013957,she was throwing snowballs at the sky
sample-013958,i was expecting you
sample-013959,will i learn to do that someday the boy asked
sample-013960,it said that the darkest hour of the night came just before the dawn
sample-013961,he was planning as he left the bar
sample-013962,the greatest authority on meteorites stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles
sample-013963,i'm hunting with my falcon the alchemist answered
sample-013964,then where is your gun
sample-013965,and they had understood each other perfectly well
sample-013966,she's going to lose her mind when she finds out
sample-013967,well then stand up
sample-013968,but the crystal merchant had no choice
sample-013969,the boy put the stones in his pouch
sample-013970,i want you to help me turn myself into the wind the boy answered
sample-013971,we're refugees from the tribal wars and we need money the other figure said
sample-013972,the alchemist opened a bottle and poured a red liquid into the boy's cup
sample-013973,does it make sense to have negative weights
sample-013974,we've got to produce a show now
sample-013975,i'll be back the boy said
sample-013976,he had come to the town only to find a woman who could interpret his dream
sample-013977,henderson was taking it in
sample-013978,the nearby city of ceuta had grown faster than tangier and business had fallen off
sample-013979,the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
sample-013980,then it became a signal of danger
sample-013981,maybe no one here knows what an alchemist is
sample-013982,this was the strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space
sample-013983,they're only made of rock crystal and there are millions of rock crystals in the earth
sample-013984,it could have been steel silver or platinum
sample-013985,it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-013986,it's in all the afternoon papers
sample-013987,they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
sample-013988,i wanted them to be a part of your inheritance
sample-013989,one of these days is tomorrow
sample-013990,i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
sample-013991,where's your coat and hat
sample-013992,all i say is spit them out
sample-013993,in those days very few of the people had any idea about astronomy
sample-013994,the experimental methodology lacks separate validation set
sample-013995,the tea seemed less bitter
sample-013996,now im scared of what is inside of pies
sample-013997,he had never imagined that questions about life would be of such importance to a shepherd
sample-013998,come into my office
sample-013999,almost everyone here speaks spanish
sample-014000,and i'd better read your books said the boy
sample-014001,upon returning to the wise man he related in detail everything he had seen
sample-014002,the crowd swayed a little as i elbowed my way through
sample-014003,he told fatima that at their next meeting
sample-014004,she told me to write a play for tonight
sample-014005,any statement on the red uprising tomorrow
sample-014006,i had the everyone has gary busey's teeth dream again
sample-014007,you can't go any farther one of them said
sample-014008,the book was written in spanish
sample-014009,as the englishman left fatima arrived and filled her vessel with water
sample-014010,she just called me
sample-014011,you know you did
sample-014012,he transformed himself into a stone that rolled up to the miner's foot
sample-014013,i learned how to care for sheep and i haven't forgotten how that's done
sample-014014,in his heart he wanted to remain awake but he also wanted to sleep
sample-014015,but then he stopped
sample-014016,but the alchemist continued to look to the horizon
sample-014017,pedro hugged his teddy as hard as he could
sample-014018,it's what you have always wanted to accomplish
sample-014019,but the boy knew that he was referring to fatima
sample-014020,you'd better start right now
sample-014021,toward the end of the afternoon they came upon a coptic monastery
sample-014022,lots of shepherds passed through selling their wool
sample-014023,the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
sample-014024,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
sample-014025,it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
sample-014026,i'll be back in a minute
sample-014027,another hour to write it
sample-014028,the land was ruined and i had to find some other way to earn a living
sample-014029,you don't have to sign anything
sample-014030,only in that way would he be able to read the omens
sample-014031,about eleven i walked back to my home in maybury because nothing seemed to be happening
sample-014032,i think jamie did it
sample-014033,he was dressed only in his pajamas
sample-014034,i'm the leader of the caravan said a darkeyed bearded man
sample-014035,they mounted their horses and rode out in the direction of the pyramids of egypt
sample-014036,about eleven i walked back to my home in maybury because nothing seemed to be happening
sample-014037,the boy thought of fatima
sample-014038,the boy went to look for the englishman
sample-014039,perhaps she met somebody
sample-014040,you have no idea what's happened to me
sample-014041,there is no wine in this country the young man said
sample-014042,sometimes it's better to be with the sheep who don't say anything
sample-014043,gypsies are experts at getting people to do that sighed the old man
sample-014044,the boy stepped closer to the girl and when she smiled he did the same
sample-014045,but i'd like to see the castles in the towns where they live the boy explained
sample-014046,she accused an exconvict of stalking and sexual assault
sample-014047,scattered groups of people were hurrying from the direction of woking
sample-014050,there are only eight flags up there now
sample-014051,i've never seen her before
sample-014052,but don't worry the alchemist continued
sample-014053,i went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the dark
sample-014054,at the camp it was difficult to see anything
sample-014055,but this payment goes well beyond my generosity the monk responded
sample-014056,henderson stood up with a spade in his hand
sample-014057,but now the sounds inside had stopped
sample-014068,you just don't know all that you've done
sample-014069,but don't let that out of your sight
sample-014078,the levanter increased in intensity
sample-014079,hundreds must have seen it and taken it for a falling star
sample-014080,it brought his heart into his mouth
sample-014081,can i come in
sample-014082,but as time passed tangier had changed
sample-014083,have trusted more in your love for fatima
sample-014084,it seemed so safe and tranquil
sample-014085,the levanter increased in intensity
sample-014086,it was more activity than usual for this time of the morning
sample-014087,it rattled menacingly
sample-014090,i'm not afraid of any newspapers
sample-014091,the boy was also saddened his friend was in pursuit of his destiny
sample-014092,something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top
sample-014093,strange images passed through my mind
sample-014094,you don't have to apologize
sample-014095,he sat on a stone and allowed himself to become hypnotized by the horizon
sample-014096,most of them were staring quietly at the big table
sample-014097,i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
sample-014108,the brake fluid was leaking out onto the path
sample-014109,want to give my flower a drink
sample-014118,i have to find a man who knows that universal language
sample-014119,i had it served with my breakfast this morning
sample-014120,the carpet was exquisite
sample-014121,no one said a word as the old man continued
sample-014122,of course the two were unable to do anything
sample-014123,he moved about invisible but everyone could hear him
sample-014124,it is rare that i get to sit down and write during the day
sample-014125,they mounted their horses and rode out in the direction of the pyramids of egypt
sample-014126,but i'm going to egypt the boy said
sample-014127,she felt like a weakling in comparison to her newborn daughter
sample-014130,i've been looking for you all morning he said as he led the boy outside
sample-014131,they went on smoking the pipe for a while as the sun began to set
sample-014132,jupiter has a great red spot
sample-014133,the boy felt a pang in his heart thinking about the merchant's daughter
sample-014134,and that other honeymoon in a coal mine
sample-014135,ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
sample-014136,he just got a new kite for his birthday
sample-014137,as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
sample-014140,what's up homies
sample-014141,you're the biggest person in town
sample-014142,is sheriff helen in there
sample-014143,the englishman had several suitcases filled with books
sample-014144,after all he had all his money
sample-014145,i wonder what molly put in those tacos
sample-014146,for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
sample-014147,he had never even wept in front of his own sheep
sample-014148,the congestion was heavy throughout the city
sample-014149,eventually the merchant had to hire two more employees
sample-014150,only chris couldn't wait quite as long as the others
sample-014151,how many people do you think will be there
sample-014152,tux is not smiling he just looks nice all the time
sample-014153,what's from the governor
sample-014154,she doesn't have the money
sample-014155,when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
sample-014156,a steel framed table separated one half of the room from the other
sample-014157,the angel touched the man's shoulder and they were both projected far into the future
sample-014158,i'm leaving today said the boy
sample-014159,they are so used to me that they know my schedule he muttered
sample-014160,times are different now
sample-014161,but i'm going in search of my treasure the boy said
sample-014162,i need it to get to the pyramids he said
sample-014163,the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees
sample-014164,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
sample-014165,and that he a boy could perform miracles
sample-014166,an army is coming the boy said
sample-014167,henderson stood up with a spade in his hand
sample-014168,but he decided first to buy his bakery and put some money aside
sample-014169,if you want it you must take it
sample-014170,what do you think you're doing
sample-014171,and you can meet us at the station
sample-014172,he transformed himself into a stone that rolled up to the miner's foot
sample-014173,but everything had changed
sample-014174,you don't have to go with me
sample-014175,people talk a lot about omens thought the shepherd
sample-014176,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
sample-014177,many people are not able to use their first language correctly
sample-014178,the boy told him then that he needed to get to the pyramids
sample-014179,would you mind seeing me to the door
sample-014180,four hundred and fifty dollars
sample-014181,if i told you it might not come true
sample-014182,i can't quite hear you
sample-014183,he understands the forces of nature
sample-014184,that's a lot of gold
sample-014185,if you can concentrate always on the present you'll be a happy man
sample-014186,you can't believe it's not butter
sample-014187,he's doing it because it's what he wants to do
sample-014188,servants came and went with silver trays laden with spices and tea
sample-014189,you lived your life in a loving way and died with dignity
sample-014190,he just got a new kite for his birthday
sample-014191,and yet none of these people has ever met the old king
sample-014192,but fatima's hands held to the handles of her jug
sample-014193,if i had told you you wouldn't have seen the pyramids
sample-014194,the omens had been true after all
sample-014195,he remembered the sword
sample-014196,younger man what he had seen and the man asked him to wait there
sample-014197,my keyboard is filled with dust
sample-014198,i just want to dream about mecca
sample-014199,i'm going to them
sample-014200,it's got to be somewhere
sample-014201,the boy closed his book
sample-014202,would you show these gentlemen to the door
sample-014203,her jeans have holes in them
sample-014205,he was already re accustomed to desert's silence
sample-014206,they seemed to laugh at him and he laughed back his heart bursting with joy
sample-014207,and in that way the months passed
sample-014208,but those who know about such things would know that those are urim and thummim
sample-014209,the guy thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to stop him
sample-014211,he was tense and upset because he knew that the old man was right
sample-014212,he also tried to remember some good stories to relate as he sheared the sheep
sample-014213,there were mountains in the distance
sample-014214,there was surely a baker in her town
sample-014215,it seemed such a little thing so bright and small and still
sample-014216,everyone seemed very excited
sample-014217,maybe we can wait a little bit before changing the titles and the text everywhere else
sample-014218,what tricks would i pull
sample-014219,the monk was irritated
sample-014220,got to be a sergeant
sample-014221,and continue to pay heed to the omens
sample-014222,but i didnt think that it contained any living creature
sample-014223,when i returned to the common the sun was setting
sample-014224,and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
sample-014225,the tea seemed less bitter
sample-014226,'m all about those invisible cosmic connections that transcend time and distance
sample-014227,it's not easy to find the philosopher's stone said the englishman
sample-014228,i'm trying to explain to my mother how to get pictures off her phone
sample-014229,among these people were a couple of cyclists a gardener i employed sometimes and a girl carrying a baby
sample-014230,it has happened many times before
sample-014231,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
sample-014232,but here's the funniest part of it all
sample-014233,i never said any such thing
sample-014234,yes that's what love is
sample-014235,the boy looked around him at the date palms
sample-014236,she sends for you
sample-014237,but they were not there
sample-014239,the authors claim to specifically address variations due to geometric transformations in the acquired images
sample-014240,but there they saw a crystal shop that offered refreshing mint tea
sample-014241,he didn't know the man yet but his practiced eye would recognize him when he appeared
sample-014242,that's got nothing to do with it
sample-014243,i'm sure i don't know what you're talking about
sample-014244,beat it out and get hold of some guys
sample-014245,it's as much my fault as yours
sample-014246,i have watched the caravan as it crossed the desert he said
sample-014247,instead the stranger lowered it slowly until the point touched the boy's forehead
sample-014250,it picks up on the mike
sample-014251,maybe because that wasn't really his dream
sample-014252,but when the reign of tiberius ended his poems were forgotten
sample-014253,i've got a weakness
sample-014254,all things are one
sample-014255,they say at patti's house he left two hours ago
sample-014256,he loosened the reins on his horse who galloped forward over the rocks and sand
sample-014257,i'd better hustle him up
sample-014268,what had been next to him five minutes ago was now at the other side
sample-014269,the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
sample-014278,i don't know how to find life in the desert the boy said
sample-014279,the hand with the whip pointed to the south
sample-014280,i want you to be my wife
sample-014281,'and this is what your son said' the angel told the man
sample-014282,the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
sample-014283,the caravans had been stopped at giza for some time waiting for the wars to end
sample-014284,artisanal gin bar seriously
sample-014285,the idea is still good
sample-014286,sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
sample-014287,they didn't have the printing press in those days the boy argued
sample-014290,you must love the desert but never trust it completely
sample-014291,and tomorrow his enemy would also be a part of that soul
sample-014292,aren't you going to tell me
sample-014293,the dunes are changed by the wind but the desert never changes
sample-014294,everyone toasted the bride and groom
sample-014295,ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
sample-014296,my name is melchizedek said the old man
sample-014297,glad he took the t out of that
sample-014308,there were really i think two or three hundred people elbowing one another
sample-014309,no the alchemist answered
sample-014318,the alchemist stopped abruptly and bent to the ground
sample-014319,it commenced to blow harder raising the desert sands
sample-014320,from that day on it was the desert that would be important
sample-014321,a hundred nuns stampeded the vatican
sample-014322,when he was a child that man wanted to travel too
sample-014323,my seven year resume gap is marked not drugs
sample-014324,that's the man who knows all the secrets of the world she said
sample-014325,and shouldn't they be garnished
sample-014326,don't ask me why i don't know why
sample-014327,i've just misplaced eight thousand dollars
sample-014330,so the wind blew with all its strength and the sky was filled with sand
sample-014331,the greatest authority on meteorites stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles
sample-014332,you could save that poor devil's life
sample-014333,the infidels had an evil look about them
sample-014334,do you like cooking
sample-014335,they have prejudices against foreigners
sample-014336,it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
sample-014337,it's a man who understands nature and the world
sample-014340,the steel of its blade glittered in the light of the moon
sample-014341,the library is open to everyone
sample-014342,he paused and his eyes were still unfriendly
sample-014343,except for the dream
sample-014344,the burning fire had been extinguished
sample-014345,christmas eve at midnight
sample-014346,i'm afraid you're blocking my view
sample-014347,but instead of being saddened he was happy
sample-014348,the boy remembered an old proverb from his country
sample-014349,the burning fire had been extinguished
sample-014350,when the blinding dust had settled a bit the boy trembled at what he saw
sample-014351,for a moment everything was dark and scary
sample-014352,but you also benefit from the estimable builtin support such as contexts task switching and window management
sample-014353,she reversed the charges
sample-014354,their faces were hidden behind blue veils with only their eyes showing
sample-014355,let's pretend everything is prepped
sample-014356,he learned swimming in school
sample-014357,all who went there were happy at having done so
sample-014358,is there a mrs joshua
sample-014359,the englishman didn't answer him directly
sample-014360,but he had found a guide and didn't want to miss out on an opportunity
sample-014361,the young arab took out a book and began to read
sample-014362,i want my wife
sample-014363,but you've got to leave me alone
sample-014364,i have watched the caravan as it crossed the desert he said
sample-014365,now how'd you know that
sample-014366,and at that i told him and he took my place
sample-014367,if you know your heart well it will never be able to do that to you
sample-014368,if i send him to his dads he wont get bathed for a week
sample-014369,he had always believed that the sheep were able to understand what he said
sample-014370,i'll let you know as soon as i have something
sample-014371,we've run out of petrol and diesel
sample-014372,i need you to be spontaneous he asked me out to din din
sample-014373,i'll do anything you say
sample-014374,he paid for the wool and asked the shepherd to come back the following year
sample-014375,the boy awoke before dawn
sample-014376,the boy began to dig into the dune
sample-014377,now leave us alone said the boy to the young arab
sample-014378,you skinned him alive
sample-014379,its lower end was still embedded
sample-014380,from where he sat he could observe the plaza
sample-014381,the desert fills men's hearts with visions the camel driver answered
sample-014382,but now the sounds inside had stopped
sample-014383,i can't please everybody
sample-014384,there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
sample-014385,i'm not going to charge you anything now she said
sample-014386,at the first glance it was really not very exciting
sample-014387,darling i have a gift for you
sample-014388,i don't know why
sample-014389,he needed someone to talk to so as to avoid thinking about the possibility of war
sample-014390,i'm going to hate those who have found their treasure because i never found mine
sample-014391,i could see something in their faces
sample-014392,he had studied latin spanish and theology
sample-014393,just as your grandfather taught you
sample-014394,and a new contract goes with it
sample-014395,i heard a faint movement under my feet
sample-014396,then they got ahold of some dough and went goofy
sample-014397,it's not easy to find the philosopher's stone said the englishman
sample-014398,arabs often appeared in the city shopping and chanting their strange prayers several times a day
sample-014399,we had to rush down the minute it happened
sample-014400,i'll give it a drink
sample-014401,are you going to let her out
sample-014402,you get somebody else to wash the diapers
sample-014403,well usually i learn more from my sheep than from books he answered
sample-014404,did you see the garden that it took the master gardener ten years to create
sample-014405,i'm a desert woman and i'm proud of that
sample-014406,my tax dollars pay for those public school proms
sample-014407,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
sample-014408,you already know all you need to know
sample-014409,you seem to think i've never done this before
sample-014410,just a memory right now it signified shade water and a refuge from the war
sample-014411,as he sat there thinking he sensed movement above him
sample-014412,he just got a new kite for his birthday
sample-014413,she has always been very kind and friendly to everyone even strangers
sample-014414,he regretted having spoken to the camel driver about what he had seen in the desert
sample-014415,he was my brother
sample-014416,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
sample-014417,i turned and as i did so the screw must have fallen out
sample-014418,the big guy there
sample-014419,i said i wish i'd never been born
sample-014420,who wants to see liver pills
sample-014421,is that what you want me to tell vincent
sample-014422,it is i who dared to do so said the boy
sample-014423,i have watched the caravan as it crossed the desert he said
sample-014424,the merchant looked anxiously at the boy
sample-014425,it's a dream in the language of the world she said
sample-014426,they'll take care of it
sample-014427,the space was spartan almost bare
sample-014428,that's true enough the boy thought ruefully
sample-014429,coming home a party of tourists passed us singing and playing music
sample-014430,he was planning as he left the bar
sample-014431,but can we trust him
sample-014432,if i don't find it i can always go home
sample-014433,you know i didn't tell anybody i was coming here
sample-014434,some went away while i was there and other people came
sample-014435,another run on the bank
sample-014436,i was frightened by a presence in my house that whispered terrible things
sample-014437,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
sample-014438,but he had to move on
sample-014439,brenda peters just escaped from the county jail
sample-014440,he approached the mass and was surprised at the size and the shape
sample-014441,the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
sample-014442,might just as well be
sample-014443,then what does she want with you
sample-014444,and i'm the biggest of the lot
sample-014445,i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
sample-014446,but maybe people who felt that way had never learned the universal language
sample-014447,the city was still sleeping
sample-014450,nobody knows where she got it
sample-014451,it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-014452,but finally he agreed that the boy who spoke better arabic than he should do so
sample-014453,i heard a faint movement under my feet
sample-014454,and she stood there mortified
sample-014455,he left without saying goodbye to the crystal merchant
sample-014456,and better still to be alone with one's books
sample-014457,that's a christmas present from a very dear friend of mine
sample-014468,his eyes filled with tears as he spoke of the prophet
sample-014469,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
sample-014478,he began to dig at the base of the sycamore
sample-014479,watch out for his venom the boy said
sample-014480,he quickly pulled his hands away
sample-014481,the airplane rose gracefully into the sky
sample-014482,the jacket had a purpose and so did the boy
sample-014483,he had tried in vain to establish a relationship with an alchemist
sample-014484,i shall make us some ice cubes
sample-014485,many of them had been right about what they said while some had been wrong
sample-014486,has melanie scott been in the papers
sample-014487,some went away while i was there and other people came
sample-014490,maybe the alchemist has never been in love the boy thought
sample-014491,the desert takes our men from us and they don't always return she said
sample-014492,you get out of here quick
sample-014493,but he kept the sword in his hand
sample-014494,my mobile phone has some battery issues
sample-014495,i want those stamps
sample-014496,mary told me that she got to meet up with you while she was back in san francisco
sample-014497,it was harassment pure and simple
sample-014508,i'm proud of you
sample-014509,she keeps saying that she has no regrets about moving back home but im not sure if its entirely true
sample-014518,i won a flower
sample-014519,my seven year resume gap is marked not drugs
sample-014520,i'm going with you the boy said
sample-014521,my seven year resume gap is marked not drugs
sample-014522,so how will we name all these hurricanes
sample-014523,everyone when they are young knows what their destiny is
sample-014524,you'll live and you'll learn that a man shouldn't be so stupid
sample-014525,the englishman could not contain his excitement
sample-014526,the whole army of them
sample-014527,that's the principle that governs all things he said
sample-014530,you wanna take this outside
sample-014531,that's exactly what i thought
sample-014532,he wandered for a while keeping the date palms of the oasis within sight
sample-014533,it'd be too late
sample-014534,get me a rewrite woman
sample-014535,where do you live
sample-014536,as soon as he saw me among the crowd he called to me to come down
sample-014537,the vertex was out of alignment
sample-014540,this is for the boy
sample-014541,it's extremely suspicious that there's no information about brains that didn't come from a brain
sample-014542,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
sample-014543,but if you have to go before then go on in pursuit of your dream
sample-014544,i saw a young man standing on the cylinder and trying to scramble out of the hole again
sample-014545,in any case the desert was impassable
sample-014546,i'm trying to think of something before those reporters get back
sample-014547,i'm going to school
sample-014548,there are many languages spoken by things the boy said
sample-014549,i understand sheep they're no longer a problem and they can be good friends
sample-014550,i'm trying to explain to my mother how to get pictures off her phone
sample-014551,this man looked exactly the same except that now the roles were reversed
sample-014552,but the crystal merchant had no choice
sample-014553,they all say they wrote the letter
sample-014554,it was the most delicious wine he had ever tasted
sample-014555,i have the money i need to buy my sheep
sample-014556,he paid for the wool and asked the shepherd to come back the following year
sample-014557,she's accused of stealing a watch
sample-014558,the greatest authority on meteorites stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles
sample-014559,how are the weights computed
sample-014560,my wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red green and yellow signal lights
sample-014561,whom are you calling now
sample-014563,i have no information about troops or about the movement of the tribes
sample-014564,like eating or sleeping or like seeking love or finding a job
sample-014565,it was as if the world had fallen silent because the boy's soul had
sample-014566,most of them were staring quietly at the big table
sample-014567,the strange horseman drew an enormous curved sword from a scabbard mounted on his saddle
sample-014568,i thought tonight i'd put miss kelly there
sample-014569,there were raised voicesand some sort of struggle appeared to be going on 
sample-014570,there are powerful forces on both sides and the war is important to both armies
sample-014571,or a man into the wind
sample-014572,i'm never more aware of a room's acoustics than when i'm trying to enjoy a snack i have no intention of sharing
sample-014573,before long maybe in just a few days he would be at the pyramids
sample-014574,you're worth your weight in gold
sample-014575,because of the omens the alchemist answered
sample-014577,you want the moon
sample-014578,my tax dollars pay for those public school proms
sample-014579,i can't let her out
sample-014580,everyone seemed very excited
sample-014581,she's just about to close up the library
sample-014582,you forgot to pack it
sample-014583,it seemed so safe and tranquil
sample-014584,they have gotten used to my being away and so have i
sample-014585,well why did you say that i don't know about love the sun asked the boy
sample-014586,as soon as he saw me among the crowd he called to me to come down
sample-014587,i suppose that's true in a way
sample-014588,the boy promised himself that when he returned from egypt he would buy that sword
sample-014590,new spinner movement a racket
sample-014591,and he hadn't perceived them because he had become accustomed to them
sample-014592,be less complicated without a family
sample-014593,you can't do that to me
sample-014594,that was a little girl named mary hatch
sample-014595,i noticed that the boy answered
sample-014596,henderson stood up with a spade in his hand
sample-014597,in order to find the treasure you will have to follow the omens
sample-014598,i'm afraid it'll be steve tina
sample-014599,and now an amanda derek convention
sample-014600,the sword didn't fall
sample-014601,the shepherd swore that he would

sample-014603,i have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk which was embedded in the ground
sample-014604,he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
sample-014605,i need you to be spontaneous he asked me out to din din
sample-014606,you didn't set the indicator before leaving the roundabout
sample-014607,the swimming pool was full of chlorine
sample-014608,had our instruments permitted it we might have been able to see the trouble way back when
sample-014609,i want to talk to both of you
sample-014610,don't try to enter into the life of the oasis
sample-014611,looking around he sought his sheep and then realized that he was in a new world
sample-014612,but can we trust him
sample-014613,the boy picked up his pouch and put it with his other things
sample-014614,it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
sample-014615,for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
sample-014616,you'd better start right now
sample-014617,the man who bought them last week was american
sample-014618,and don't forget the language of omens
sample-014619,the tribal chieftain called for the boy and presented him with fifty pieces of gold
sample-014620,it was a pleasant change from talking to his sheep
sample-014621,he understands the forces of nature
sample-014622,the nearby city of ceuta had grown faster than tangier and business had fallen off
sample-014623,she lives in the park
sample-014624,i think you're a great guy
sample-014625,she and her friends are always up against systems of control
sample-014626,they crossed the desert for another two days in silence
sample-014627,show me where there is life out in the desert
sample-014628,this is what i wished for
sample-014629,once again he was experiencing the language without words
sample-014630,the level ground was blackened as far as one could see and it was still giving off smoke
sample-014631,the camel driver though seemed not to be very concerned with the threat of war
sample-014632,i went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the dark
sample-014633,paracetamol should get rid of that pain
sample-014634,he had tried in vain to establish a relationship with an alchemist
sample-014635,he took his plate grabbed a knife and fork and scowled at the savagery on television
sample-014636,take these capsules over to mrs david's house
sample-014637,on the following day the first clear sign of danger appeared
sample-014638,he said that everything has its own destiny
sample-014639,it was only when i got this close to it that the strangeness of it was at all evident to me
sample-014640,he knew what i was thinking the boy said to himself
sample-014641,what is an alchemist he asked finally
sample-014642,he's insane or drunk or something
sample-014643,the night was warm and i was thirsty
sample-014644,the boy had never even noticed that there was a hole in his pouch
sample-014645,how do you suppose ken got that gun
sample-014646,the stranger withdrew the sword from the boy's forehead and the boy felt immensely relieved
sample-014647,from there he could see africa in the distance
sample-014650,words can hurt very much
sample-014651,alfayoum is in egypt said the arab
sample-014652,it was as if the world had fallen silent because the boy's soul had
sample-014653,that's the man who knows all the secrets of the world she said
sample-014654,fatima the girl said averting her eyes
sample-014655,the families will be here soon
sample-014656,i told the truth and the district attorney knows it
sample-014657,my tax dollars pay for those public school proms
sample-014668,there is only one way to learn the alchemist answered
sample-014669,but the crystal merchant had no choice
sample-014678,lemme have the desk
sample-014679,because life wants you to achieve your destiny
sample-014680,back into the excavation
sample-014681,i can see that
sample-014682,he looked like an arab which was not unusual in those parts
sample-014683,christopher was confused
sample-014684,she was waiting for her response
sample-014685,one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
sample-014686,carol hid inside the shipping container
sample-014687,it was the most delicious wine he had ever tasted
sample-014690,a large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered
sample-014691,wait until it happens to you sometime
sample-014692,and got it out as soon as you can
sample-014693,you already know all you need to know
sample-014694,imagine if everyone went around transforming lead into gold
sample-014695,i'm only speaking metaphorically of course
sample-014696,after all what he had always wanted was just that to know new places
sample-014697,we'll fix you up
sample-014708,we'll pay all your expenses
sample-014709,after all what he had always wanted was just that to know new places
sample-014718,and find out where the nearest telegraph office is
sample-014719,but i felt miserable watching him wither away like a shriveled dandelion
sample-014720,the snake fought frantically making hissing sounds that shattered the silence of the desert
sample-014721,and he knew that egypt was in africa
sample-014722,we can't leave greg here
sample-014723,do it for the paper
sample-014724,then he dropped his spade picked up his jacket and came out into the road
sample-014725,it's the emerald tablet said the englishman proud that he might teach something to the boy
sample-014726,he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
sample-014727,it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience
sample-014730,he should respect tradition
sample-014731,the boy awoke before dawn
sample-014732,think about that
sample-014733,some storms are worth the wreckage
sample-014734,about eleven i walked back to my home in maybury because nothing seemed to be happening
sample-014735,there was surely a baker in her town
sample-014736,i should have my head examined
sample-014737,the doctor says it's nothing serious
sample-014740,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
sample-014741,does she have the money
sample-014742,he had come to the town only to find a woman who could interpret his dream
sample-014743,he took back his books and packed them away again in their bags
sample-014744,i'm afraid it is important
sample-014745,i've got to talk to you straight from the shoulder
sample-014746,she'll be waiting for you in albany
sample-014747,jade's cordless drill has become faulty
sample-014748,and also by unhappiness envy and jealousy
sample-014749,the building and what
sample-014750,exactly answered the alchemist
sample-014751,storm increasing over the rockies
sample-014752,the cursor blinked expectantly
sample-014753,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
sample-014754,i thought about whether we should find coins and models in it and so on
sample-014755,the two men hurried back and found the cylinder still lying in the same position
sample-014756,but he had to move on
sample-014757,it made me very depressed
sample-014758,i was sent down here to clean house
sample-014759,tell them to hold the wire
sample-014760,they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
sample-014761,everybody quiet and ready for an emergency
sample-014762,they met with a bunch of people in the pub
sample-014763,most meteorites are more or less rounded
sample-014764,after two hours he returned to the room where the wise man was
sample-014765,how do you mean
sample-014766,i want to get back to my sheep faster
sample-014767,why should i be in any danger
sample-014768,sodium chloride is just common table salt
sample-014769,i know you're unhappy
sample-014770,at once he connected the two incidents
sample-014771,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
sample-014772,it was dropping off in flakes and raining down on the sand
sample-014773,they're just a pile of stones
sample-014774,the streamer of gas came out towards us
sample-014775,the boy was also saddened his friend was in pursuit of his destiny
sample-014776,the omens will begin insistently to speak of it and you'll try to ignore them
sample-014777,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
sample-014778,you're the biggest person in town
sample-014779,the poem was great
sample-014780,there was nothing to hold him back except himself
sample-014781,and that's another thing
sample-014782,what do you want done with them tomorrow morning
sample-014783,but don't let him interrupt you
sample-014784,your son went to serve at a distant place and became a centurion
sample-014785,where are you bound asked the young arab
sample-014786,then the thing came upon him in a flash
sample-014787,what are these things he asked
sample-014788,what about the blue one
sample-014789,and i want you to know that i'm coming back
sample-014790,ten minutes ago i had a job
sample-014791,other servants maintained the fires in the hookahs
sample-014792,your crew will do the mop up job
sample-014793,it was starlight and i explained the signs of the zodiac to her
sample-014794,they shouted consolation and promises and went off back to the town again to get help
sample-014795,the boy smiled and continued digging
sample-014796,to show you one of life's simple lessons the alchemist answered
sample-014797,but he kept quiet because he had heard what the alchemist said to the monk
sample-014798,new spinner movement a racket
sample-014799,there was very little talking
sample-014800,he approached the mass and was surprised at the size and the shape
sample-014801,don't ask me why i don't know why
sample-014802,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
sample-014803,he transformed himself into a stone that rolled up to the miner's foot
sample-014804,but he granted the travelers three days
sample-014805,the englishman asked if they were in danger
sample-014806,let me formulate a response to that question
sample-014807,i didn't come here to have you read my palm he said already regretting having come
sample-014808,for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
sample-014809,drawing from my own experience as a learner of english and german i value engaging activities that involve everyday conversation
sample-014810,the boy recalled the brilliance he had noticed on the previous day
sample-014811,i hold the power of life and death for every person i take with me
sample-014812,i wish they were rabbits
sample-014813,it's extremely suspicious that there's no information about brains that didn't come from a brain
sample-014814,he noticed the unequal cooling of its surface
sample-014815,it's extremely suspicious that there's no information about brains that didn't come from a brain
sample-014816,my name is melchizedek said the old man
sample-014817,as soon as he saw me among the crowd he called to me to come down
sample-014818,i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
sample-014819,it was a juggernaut
sample-014820,in a way so am i he said
sample-014821,my password has been changed without permission
sample-014822,i only interpret dreams
sample-014823,what kind of blow should one deliver next in order to remain alive
sample-014824,the boy trusted his new friend
sample-014825,now i will drift gently off to dreamland
sample-014826,how do you like her
sample-014827,he understands the forces of nature
sample-014828,many people in berkshire surrey and middlesex must have seen it
sample-014829,i pointed out mars a bright dot of light
sample-014830,he sat on a stone and allowed himself to become hypnotized by the horizon
sample-014831,he lives at the alfayoum oasis his friend had said
sample-014832,but there they saw a crystal shop that offered refreshing mint tea
sample-014833,the beer was more than just refreshing it was delicious
sample-014834,the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
sample-014835,a large piece suddenly came off and fell with a loud and sharp noise
sample-014836,he is going to transform himself into the wind just to demonstrate his powers
sample-014837,everyone seemed very excited
sample-014838,and the odor of the animals became a bit more tolerable
sample-014839,he wanted to tell him about fatima
sample-014848,a quarter of a million dollars
sample-014849,they set off running wildly into the trees
sample-014858,looking through the telescope i saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet
sample-014859,but one of them seized the boy and yanked him back out of the hole
sample-014860,he says it's the chance of a lifetime
sample-014861,don't say that again
sample-014862,it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
sample-014863,what are you doing here one of the figures demanded
sample-014864,it's almost as if he had been here and left his mark he thought
sample-014865,you are the best
sample-014866,i pointed out mars a bright dot of light
sample-014867,now he was here not with his flock but with a shovel
sample-014870,there is a dentist and some other doctors inside this clinic
sample-014871,i guess you forgot something
sample-014872,the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
sample-014873,i'm never more aware of a room's acoustics than when i'm trying to enjoy a snack i have no intention of sharing
sample-014874,if i don't find it i can always go home
sample-014875,let's stop this another commander said
sample-014876,he saw the boy appear from the other side of the dunes
sample-014877,and what's the matter with a thousand dollars
sample-014888,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
sample-014889,he believed in omens
sample-014898,we're going to glasgow next year
sample-014899,doesn't that make sense
sample-014900,but horses tire bit by bit
sample-014901,are you crazy the boy asked the alchemist when they had moved on
sample-014902,if you can concentrate always on the present you'll be a happy man
sample-014903,but he decided to take a chance
sample-014904,everyone seemed very excited
sample-014905,who are you he heard a voice ask him in spanish
sample-014906,it's not what enters men's mouths that's evil said the alchemist
sample-014907,that day he didn't make a cast
sample-014910,the boy fell to his knees and wept
sample-014911,but i didnt think that it contained any living creature
sample-014912,couldn't want a better life and death
sample-014913,i've just guaranteed the bank sufficient funds to meet their needs
sample-014914,only in that way would he be able to read the omens
sample-014915,the letter said that the payment was delayed
sample-014916,i couldnt stop staring at it
sample-014917,thank you said the boy
sample-014928,the land was ruined and i had to find some other way to earn a living
sample-014929,give me my book the boy said
sample-014938,it was difficult not to think about what he had left behind
sample-014939,that's a good luck omen the englishman said after the fat arab had gone out
sample-014940,why can't you be serious
sample-014941,sometimes i appear in the form of a solution or a good idea
sample-014942,they walked in from the rain all dishevelled and steaming
sample-014943,parents should look out for correct grammar and pronunciation when speaking to their children
sample-014944,exactly answered the alchemist
sample-014945,from a technical point of view the mpstandard is completely outdated and yet it's still very successful
sample-014946,you know i didn't tell anybody i was coming here
sample-014947,replace the ts in tim tebow's name with any other consonant to get a star wars character
sample-014948,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
sample-014949,he knelt down to find urim and thummim and put them back in the pouch
sample-014950,that's why i want you to continue toward your goal
sample-014951,janet roger died three months ago
sample-014952,excuse you for what
sample-014953,the englishman was disappointed
sample-014954,i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit
sample-014955,in order to find the treasure you will have to follow the omens
sample-014956,i'm going to them
sample-014957,wait till we get home
sample-014958,you don't rub the baby dry
sample-014959,i'm coming fatima he said
sample-014960,this morning i found a calculator taped to my wii
sample-014961,nothing's going to happen
sample-014962,the heather was on fire and you could see a thin blue smoke rising up slowly
sample-014963,he asked it please never to stop speaking to him
sample-014964,she couldn't decide which dress to wear
sample-014965,a man down on earth needs our help
sample-014966,revenge is not my style but obviously accidents will happen
sample-014967,why do they need gin
sample-014968,i was scared but wasted no time in going out and crossing the bridge to the sand pits
sample-014969,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
sample-014970,he noticed the unequal cooling of its surface
sample-014971,shall i put a little rum in the coffee
sample-014972,the boy recalled the brilliance he had noticed on the previous day
sample-014973,some storms are worth the wreckage
sample-014974,he took out his money and counted it
sample-014975,and if you improve on the present what comes later will also be better
sample-014976,to nourish the falcon
sample-014977,some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound
sample-014978,in alchemy it's called the soul of the world
sample-014979,the oasis is neutral ground
sample-014980,he had assumed he would soon return to his sheep
sample-014981,but it's just something i forgot to pack
sample-014982,you're hurting my sore foot
sample-014983,two horsemen waiting ahead of them
sample-014984,you're not fooling anybody
sample-014985,i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
sample-014986,may i go in and see him
sample-014987,he doesn't have anything else
sample-014988,the boy swore that every time he heard the alarm he would heed its message
sample-014989,the battles may last for a long time perhaps even years
sample-014990,fatima appeared at the entrance to the tent
sample-014991,i thought about whether we should find coins and models in it and so on
sample-014992,where your treasure is there also will be your heart the alchemist had told him
sample-014993,but the marketplace was empty and he was far from home so he wept
sample-014994,i have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk which was embedded in the ground
sample-014995,i'm afraid i already know a great many people
sample-014996,we speak of them only to children
sample-014997,its been a long time since she last read chekhov and because of that she no longer feels like the heroine of her own story
sample-014998,for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
sample-014999,yeah better if people are already familiar with one and are thinking of switching to the other
sample-015000,there was enough there to buy a lot of weapons
sample-015001,so what should i do now the boy asked
sample-015002,dragon is pretty frustrating so you want to do everything you can to minimize that
sample-015003,the alchemist turned to the boy
sample-015004,it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
sample-015005,i have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk which was embedded in the ground
sample-015006,that's why i'm an angel second class
sample-015007,it was a pleasant change from talking to his sheep
sample-015010,then i don't get paid
sample-015011,did she ever go exploring
sample-015012,i need you to be spontaneous he asked me out to din din
sample-015013,what's so illogical about that
sample-015014,then the thing came upon him in a flash
sample-015015,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
sample-015016,and this is your coat
sample-015017,and at that i told him and he took my place
sample-015028,some storms are worth the wreckage
sample-015029,the boy preferred wine
sample-015038,at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars
sample-015039,an army is coming the boy said
sample-015040,the letter's our only clue
sample-015041,i'm smoking too much
sample-015042,then suddenly he noticed it with a start
sample-015043,the omens will begin insistently to speak of it and you'll try to ignore them
sample-015044,it brought his heart into his mouth
sample-015045,you don't think i'm gonna tell
sample-015046,the prolific developer contributed more than a thousand commits until today
sample-015047,his way isn't the same as mine nor mine as his
sample-015048,before long maybe in just a few days he would be at the pyramids
sample-015049,that's true the boy thought
sample-015050,i pointed out mars a bright dot of light
sample-015051,the boy listened quietly
sample-015052,'m all about those invisible cosmic connections that transcend time and distance
sample-015053,the boy's heart began to speak of fear
sample-015054,the book that most interested the boy told the stories of the famous alchemists
sample-015055,maybe that's why they came
sample-015056,she looks so gorgeous today
sample-015057,the man was speaking the language of alchemy
sample-015058,four hundred and fifty dollars
sample-015059,he knew he was stronger than his friend
sample-015060,he had seen the shooting star and was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere nearby
sample-015061,and one can always come back
sample-015062,as they moved along the boy tried to listen to his heart
sample-015063,i bet it's a going away present
sample-015064,i never even noticed she had one
sample-015065,can you remember anything at all
sample-015066,but none of that is from the pyramids said the alchemist
sample-015067,i didn't come here to have you read my palm he said already regretting having come
sample-015068,a practice of infidels he said to himself
sample-015069,you can't believe it's not butter
sample-015070,we're just slowly plodding through some user interviews at the moment
sample-015071,i make my living forecasting the future for people he said
sample-015072,he just got a new kite for his birthday
sample-015073,i'm doing much better and soon you'll be able to return to your sheep
sample-015074,mind if i sit down
sample-015075,there are many languages spoken by things the boy said
sample-015076,i don't want to kill anybody
sample-015077,they set off running wildly into the trees
sample-015078,how do i guess at the future
sample-015079,all things are one
sample-015080,can i get a woot woot
sample-015081,he also tried to remember some good stories to relate as he sheared the sheep
sample-015082,all the lawyers in the world aren't going to help you
sample-015083,imagine if everyone went around transforming lead into gold
sample-015084,sometimes it's better to be with the sheep who don't say anything
sample-015085,and what do you do in salem he insisted
sample-015086,it seemed he had made the long journey for nothing
sample-015087,it's extremely suspicious that there's no information about brains that didn't come from a brain
sample-015088,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
sample-015089,you see what i had to put up with
sample-015090,the wind has many names
sample-015091,take these capsules over to mrs david's house
sample-015092,the man wept with happiness
sample-015093,i'm afraid that if my dream is realized i'll have no reason to go on living
sample-015094,his father said no more
sample-015095,it's a direct line to both my office and my apartment
sample-015096,they began to ride out over the sands with the moon lighting their way
sample-015097,when the blinding dust had settled a bit the boy trembled at what he saw
sample-015098,i owe everything to corey brown
sample-015099,in a couple of minutes
sample-015100,where did he keep his money
sample-015101,keep your shirt on
sample-015102,the boy took them to the cliff where he had been on the previous day
sample-015103,you'll never get it out of me
sample-015104,the owner of the bar came over and looked as well
sample-015105,if good things are coming they will be a pleasant surprise said the seer
sample-015106,the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees
sample-015107,air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
sample-015108,the boy noticed that the man's clothing was strange
sample-015109,my mind ran on the possibilities of its content
sample-015110,i've crossed these sands many times said one of the camel drivers one night
sample-015111,i didn't know shepherds knew how to read said a girl's voice behind him
sample-015112,i have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk which was embedded in the ground
sample-015113,it could be computed in many ways which would give more or less equivalent results
sample-015114,casper predicted the outcome
sample-015115,i don't know the desert that well yet
sample-015116,the level ground was blackened as far as one could see and it was still giving off smoke
sample-015117,do it for the paper
sample-015118,somebody cut us off
sample-015119,the xylophone would just be a glockenspiel if it wasn't so metal
sample-015120,ask the mastermind
sample-015121,it was glaringly hot not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind
sample-015122,vibrations of peace throughout the tent
sample-015123,two days ago you said that i had never dreamed of travel the merchant answered
sample-015124,he had been to the village only once the year before
sample-015125,where are you from the boy asked
sample-015127,i should say not
sample-015128,the tradition teaches men how to cross the desert and how their children should marry
sample-015129,take a sponge some dish liquid and a towel then get to work
sample-015130,the sheep fidgeted nearby uneasy with their new owner and excited by so much change
sample-015131,they shouted consolation and promises and went off back to the town again to get help
sample-015133,i mostly used it for web browsing and occasionally writing emails
sample-015134,surveillance does not always bring security
sample-015135,all things are one the old man had said
sample-015136,a shepherd may like to travel but he should never forget about his sheep
sample-015137,she was supposed to come down and get you
sample-015138,but i found it difficult to get to work because of the investigations
sample-015139,but there they saw a crystal shop that offered refreshing mint tea
sample-015148,can i help you asked the man behind the window
sample-015149,you haven't seen anything yet
sample-015158,who is this stranger who speaks of omens asked one of the chieftains eyeing the boy
sample-015159,i just want to dream about mecca
sample-015160,what could i do
sample-015161,they both spoke the same language
sample-015162,why didn't you say something
sample-015163,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
sample-015164,all i say is spit them out
sample-015165,i'm observing passiveaggressive behavior the psychologist said in a professional tone
sample-015166,you must not let up even after having come so far he continued
sample-015167,it picks up on the mike
sample-015170,i'll give you a break
sample-015171,what would you do
sample-015172,this is the morning post you're talking to
sample-015173,sometimes there's just no way to hold back the river
sample-015174,everything in the universe evolved he said
sample-015175,i'll always remember it
sample-015176,the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
sample-015177,because life wants you to achieve your destiny
sample-015188,the boy put the stones in his pouch
sample-015189,and i'm sorry to say that the congestion is increasing
sample-015198,the boy continued to listen to his heart as they crossed the desert
sample-015199,i just don't trust anyone who says they've never had hamburger helper
sample-015200,i told you that your dream was a difficult one
sample-015201,the italian got her words mixed up
sample-015202,maybe i will say it
sample-015203,is sam with you
sample-015204,the burning fire had been extinguished
sample-015205,the boy put the stones in his pouch
sample-015206,but men began to reject simple things and to write tracts interpretations and philosophical studies
sample-015207,i'm going to them
sample-015210,the streamer of gas came out towards us
sample-015211,the gods should not have desires because they don't have destinies
sample-015212,just handling them made him feel better
sample-015213,but the crystal merchant had no choice
sample-015214,i beg your pardon
sample-015215,yes or even search for treasure
sample-015216,and at that i told him and he took my place
sample-015217,he had understood the story the old king had told him
sample-015228,the same book that taught me about urim and thummim
sample-015229,looking up he saw a pair of hawks flying high in the sky
sample-015238,he nodded and said nothing
sample-015239,i don't blame him
sample-015240,sometimes it's better to be with the sheep who don't say anything
sample-015241,do you read me
sample-015242,he forgets the office when he's with me
sample-015243,i can always go back to being a shepherd the boy thought
sample-015244,you already know all you need to know
sample-015245,the boy fell to the sand nearly unconscious
sample-015246,the boy listened quietly
sample-015247,your eyes show the strength of your soul answered the alchemist
sample-015248,the city's lights were stunning to behold
sample-015249,it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience
sample-015250,what's so depressing about that
sample-015251,i found these one day in the fields
sample-015252,the nearby city of ceuta had grown faster than tangier and business had fallen off
sample-015253,strange images passed through my mind
sample-015254,what are they doing the old man asked pointing at the people in the plaza
sample-015255,i saw neil yesterday afternoon
sample-015256,no wonder you jumped in the river
sample-015257,once again he was experiencing the language without words
sample-015258,the families will be here soon
sample-015259,he's nuts about you
sample-015260,do you tell lies
sample-015261,what is it you're looking for asked the old merchant
sample-015262,the land was ruined and i had to find some other way to earn a living
sample-015263,the money is unimportant
sample-015264,if you have to wait until the war is over then wait
sample-015265,that day the merchant gave the boy permission to build the display
sample-015266,that was a little girl named mary hatch
sample-015267,katie screamed that they were going to lose
sample-015268,the man looked at him without responding
sample-015269,he looked around at the empty plaza again feeling less desperate than before
sample-015270,the other son was a poet and delighted all of rome with his beautiful verses
sample-015271,the boy wanted to believe that his friend had simply become separated from him by accident
sample-015272,is it for further automatic processing
sample-015273,there is only one way to learn the alchemist answered
sample-015274,you're losing your eye
sample-015275,he had assumed he would soon return to his sheep
sample-015276,then the thing came upon him in a flash
sample-015277,but that was simply because my eye was tired
sample-015278,it would be ideal if the wifi were gratis
sample-015279,casper predicted the outcome
sample-015280,say something else
sample-015281,she's kind and sweet and considerate
sample-015282,he noticed the unequal cooling of its surface
sample-015283,it was a bundle of money
sample-015284,studying these key phrases will help you while traveling
sample-015285,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
sample-015286,like eating or sleeping or like seeking love or finding a job
sample-015287,is that job still open
sample-015288,let me tell you what will happen
sample-015289,but there was a sixth day the sun went on
sample-015290,he looked like an arab which was not unusual in those parts
sample-015291,my tax dollars pay for those public school proms
sample-015292,he had no idea how he was going to transform himself into the wind
sample-015293,he's already got charge of the bank
sample-015294,what were you going to write about hillary
sample-015295,and above all don't forget to follow your destiny through to its conclusion
sample-015296,they rode alongside each other gracefully
sample-015297,and one or two persons were returning
sample-015298,i dont mind working from home most of the time but i do miss having coworkers
sample-015299,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
sample-015300,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
sample-015301,the old man gave a signal and everyone stood
sample-015302,because you are trying to realize your destiny
sample-015303,without such love one's dreams would have no meaning
sample-015304,was that question rhetorical
sample-015305,maybe i will say it
sample-015306,the thought was so dreadful to him that he forgot about the heat and went forward
sample-015307,it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience
sample-015308,he was immensely excited at the news
sample-015309,the article introduces a very fast small and shallow feedforward network which is trained endtoend
sample-015310,he felt weighted down by the centuries of time since the pyramids had been built
sample-015311,did you see uncle jake with any cash last night
sample-015312,if you know your heart well it will never be able to do that to you
sample-015313,i said i wish i'd never been born
sample-015314,toronto is a few miles away
sample-015315,never mind those guys
sample-015316,but they could never have taught him arabic
sample-015317,how do i guess at the future
sample-015318,it was the old man who spoke first
sample-015319,the alchemist told the boy to place the shell over his ear
sample-015320,for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
sample-015321,he became friendly with the camel driver who traveled alongside him
sample-015322,no one said a word as the old man continued
sample-015323,what were you going to write about hillary
sample-015324,she went backpacking around europe with a friend from high school
sample-015325,all i say is spit them out
sample-015326,he was so ashamed that he wanted to cry
sample-015327,so he began to wander through the city and found himself at the gates
sample-015328,younger man what he had seen and the man asked him to wait there
sample-015329,what is it about
sample-015330,i'll work for you he said
sample-015331,her walls were covered with dark and scary sketches
sample-015332,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
sample-015333,you left out number five
sample-015334,maybe he should not call people names that they don't want to be called
sample-015335,jim became head of the draft board
sample-015336,what's this the end of the eighth
sample-015337,but fatima's hands held to the handles of her jug
sample-015338,he told them all to be seated
sample-015339,i guess you're right
sample-015348,give five points to the good daughter book
sample-015349,strange images passed through my mind
sample-015358,it seemed such a little thing so bright and small and still
sample-015359,you're the one who may die the alchemist said
sample-015360,the pages of the book flipped upside down
sample-015361,did you get it
sample-015362,the vision vanished immediately but it had shaken him
sample-015363,so you know about love the boy said
sample-015364,the boy began to dig into the dune
sample-015365,but arms cannot be drawn unless they also go into battle
sample-015366,you're worth your weight in gold
sample-015367,the merchant turned to a customer who wanted three crystal glasses
sample-015370,drink and enjoy yourself said the alchemist noticing that the boy was feeling happier
sample-015371,rest well tonight as if you were a warrior preparing for combat
sample-015372,lemme have the desk
sample-015373,the alchemist followed as the boy's horse ran for almost half an hour
sample-015374,but none of that is from the pyramids said the alchemist
sample-015375,replace the ts in tim tebow's name with any other consonant to get a star wars character
sample-015376,i like the way she talks
sample-015377,new spinner movement a racket
sample-015388,so how will we name all these hurricanes
sample-015389,some of the grey ash was falling off the circular edge
sample-015398,or a man into the wind
sample-015399,they were strange books
sample-015400,did you hear what i said
sample-015401,she's accused of stealing a watch
sample-015402,i don't know how to explain it
sample-015403,hundreds must have seen it and taken it for a falling star
sample-015404,collateral of any kind
sample-015405,get your guns out
sample-015406,the first baseman dropped the ball
sample-015407,if you can concentrate always on the present you'll be a happy man
sample-015410,the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
sample-015411,what are they doing the old man asked pointing at the people in the plaza
sample-015412,when you play cards the first time you are almost sure to win
sample-015413,among these people were a couple of cyclists a gardener i employed sometimes and a girl carrying a baby
sample-015414,now wait a minute
sample-015415,it was after they got back from fishing
sample-015416,go back to watching the caravan he said
sample-015417,suddenly there is so much more time in a day because she no longer has to spend hours commuting
sample-015428,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
sample-015429,i need some time to think
sample-015438,that's the point at which most people give up
sample-015439,it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
sample-015440,the boy was startled
sample-015441,the alchemist opened a bottle and poured a red liquid into the boy's cup
sample-015442,they were relieved and happy
sample-015443,it was after they got back from fishing
sample-015444,we used all your imgination to design the place
sample-015445,everything i do is friendly
sample-015446,i told him we could teach her to ignore people who waste her time
sample-015447,but it is not a class that was requested by our alumni or prospective students
sample-015448,yet it was a little too large for assurance
sample-015449,the englishman's eyes lit up
sample-015450,but finally he agreed that the boy who spoke better arabic than he should do so
sample-015451,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
sample-015452,as they began to decorate the hallway a silhouette appeared in the doorway
sample-015453,the google search bar is for searching not for typing urls
sample-015454,i stopped right over there panting and waiting for further developments
sample-015455,but i like it that way
sample-015456,but he's on the right track
sample-015457,i have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk which was embedded in the ground
sample-015458,the top had certainly ceased to rotate
sample-015459,their horses cried out and all their weapons were filled with sand
sample-015460,and that's where the power of love comes in
sample-015461,let's go hiking across france
sample-015462,i can smell it
sample-015463,and he knew that egypt was in africa
sample-015464,you can get around very easily by train  which is a very relaxing and affordable way to travel
sample-015465,my name's pete davis
sample-015466,then leave with the caravan
sample-015467,think i'd better be going
sample-015468,it was dropping off in flakes and raining down on the sand
sample-015469,the emergency team came quickly
sample-015470,but if you can try to make your own decisions
sample-015471,it was flowering beautifully
sample-015472,lighthouses in a foggy world
sample-015473,have trusted more in your love for fatima
sample-015474,his last words were never heard
sample-015475,the greatest authority on meteorites stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles
sample-015476,it turned out to be a bitter tea
sample-015477,my seven year resume gap is marked not drugs
sample-015478,it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience
sample-015479,people saw me coming and welcomed me he thought
sample-015480,i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
sample-015481,he took back his books and packed them away again in their bags
sample-015482,that brings you good luck for ten years
sample-015483,the woman was silent for some time
sample-015484,it's not what enters men's mouths that's evil said the alchemist
sample-015485,work for somebody else
sample-015486,then the thing came upon him in a flash
sample-015487,there was a forest fire in los angeles
sample-015488,they went in to drink the tea which was served in beautiful crystal glasses
sample-015489,what are these things he asked
sample-015490,it's easy and yet i've never done it before he thought
sample-015491,down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
sample-015492,you have enough gold to buy many sheep and many camels
sample-015493,they inspected the menu at the restaurant
sample-015494,i wouldn't take that too seriously
sample-015495,it's the other foreigner the englishman
sample-015496,revenge is not my style but obviously accidents will happen
sample-015497,he arose and taking up his crook began to awaken the sheep that still slept
sample-015498,the scabbard was embossed in silver and the handle was black and encrusted with precious stones
sample-015499,there were three hundred wells fifty thousand date trees and innumerable colored tents spread among them
sample-015500,the boy looked around for the ovens and other apparatus used in alchemy but saw none
sample-015501,life is complicated
sample-015502,the girl dropped the container and the water spilled
sample-015503,we always observe the tradition
sample-015504,dusk was falling as the boy arrived with his herd at an abandoned church
sample-015505,something terribly important's happened
sample-015506,i read only what the birds wanted to tell me
sample-015507,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
sample-015508,at his side was the young arab the boy had spoken with earlier
sample-015509,you said it to me too
sample-015510,he condemned the commander to death without honor
sample-015511,the apples are in the basket near the door on your way out
sample-015512,here's some cheese you like
sample-015513,the sun shines so brightly
sample-015514,it was the pure language of the world
sample-015515,but then he remembered that he wasn't going to have to pay anything
sample-015516,the englishman could not contain his excitement
sample-015517,you've only had five meals today
sample-015518,sometimes their caravan met with another
sample-015519,you may kiss my hand
sample-015520,with the girl with the raven hair his days would never be the same again
sample-015521,the alchemists spent years in their laboratories observing the fire that purified the metals
sample-015522,of course the two were unable to do anything
sample-015523,henderson stood up with a spade in his hand
sample-015524,he wasn't asking for help
sample-015525,i tried to tell you right away but you started reminiscing
sample-015526,can't you just observe men and omens in order to understand the language the boy asked
sample-015527,i'm already used to the way things are
sample-015528,we don't use money in heaven
sample-015529,it'd be too late
sample-015530,only one way you can help me
sample-015531,it was dropping off in flakes and raining down on the sand
sample-015532,don't trust the smiling penguin
sample-015533,luckily there was a zebra crossing
sample-015534,i found these one day in the fields
sample-015535,nobody's going to rush me into anything
sample-015536,the alien gurgled and thrashed its tentacles
sample-015537,the oasis is neutral ground
sample-015538,he took out one of the stones
sample-015539,i was impatient to see it opened
sample-015548,the boy took out urim and thummim from his bag
sample-015549,but as time passed tangier had changed
sample-015558,i'm not very good at this
sample-015559,well why don't you go to mecca now asked the boy
sample-015560,they was both too smart for us
sample-015561,if he were fed on time he wouldn't cry
sample-015562,i went swimming with dolphins yesterday
sample-015563,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
sample-015564,let's dance
sample-015565,he looked around at the empty plaza again feeling less desperate than before
sample-015566,he must know how to deal with the snakes of the desert
sample-015567,then suddenly he noticed it with a start
sample-015570,but if you can try to make your own decisions
sample-015571,no he heard a voice on the wind say
sample-015572,with the wars between the tribes it's impossible to cross the desert
sample-015573,it's called the principle of favorability
sample-015574,my wife gave me this on my last birthday
sample-015575,we've still got two bucks left
sample-015576,do you want to go to work for me the merchant asked
sample-015577,she tied her shoelaces into a bow
sample-015588,gypsies are experts at getting people to do that sighed the old man
sample-015589,don't give in to your fears said the alchemist in a strangely gentle voice
sample-015598,and i told harry i thought i'd be bored to death
sample-015599,i guess you're right
sample-015600,he couldn't have been wrong
sample-015601,life is complicated
sample-015602,i pointed out mars a bright dot of light
sample-015603,down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
sample-015604,we like to think all our cases are important
sample-015605,alchemy is a serious discipline
sample-015606,but this payment goes well beyond my generosity the monk responded
sample-015607,hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after
sample-015610,some storms are worth the wreckage
sample-015611,i've been all over town
sample-015612,but finally the merchant appeared and asked the boy to shear four sheep
sample-015613,i'm never more aware of a room's acoustics than when i'm trying to enjoy a snack i have no intention of sharing
sample-015614,tires screeched as the cars raced around the corner
sample-015615,and the last one
sample-015616,the boy began again to read his book but he was no longer able to concentrate
sample-015617,perhaps she met somebody
sample-015628,but i'm going in search of my treasure the boy said
sample-015629,you'll use your knowledge for the welfare of the oasis and its inhabitants
sample-015638,i need it to get to the pyramids he said
sample-015639,he paid for the wool and asked the shepherd to come back the following year
sample-015641,he was more certain of it than of anything in the world
sample-015642,his arm seemed to be battling with whatever was in the hole
sample-015643,he loosened the reins on his horse who galloped forward over the rocks and sand
sample-015644,don't press the red button
sample-015645,i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
sample-015646,i found it out a little late
sample-015647,you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
sample-015648,i told you that your dream was a difficult one
sample-015649,wouldn't it be nice if we were like that
sample-015650,i want to do what i want to do
sample-015651,i'm afraid the joke's on us
sample-015652,it was there that the wise man lived
sample-015653,they provided warnings about thieves and barbarian tribes
sample-015655,if you know your heart well it will never be able to do that to you
sample-015656,henderson was taking it in
sample-015657,your heart is alive
sample-015658,the closer he got to the realization of his dream the more difficult things became
sample-015659,scattered groups of people were hurrying from the direction of woking
sample-015660,the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
sample-015661,it would have been visible to me had i only looked up as it passed
sample-015662,dense clouds of smoke or dust can be seen through a powerful telescope
sample-015663,why do you want to find that sort of person the arab asked
sample-015664,he just got a new kite for his birthday
sample-015665,he approached the mass and was surprised at the size and the shape
sample-015666,all they ever do really is look for food and water
sample-015667,it means only that the heart does what it can the alchemist said
sample-015669,the newspaper articles had prepared everyone for the reception of the idea
sample-015670,and that he a boy could perform miracles
sample-015671,he appeared with the first stars of evening
sample-015672,why not right here
sample-015673,it would have been visible to me had i only looked up as it passed
sample-015674,how could he be a fake
sample-015675,the boy spent a sleepless night
sample-015676,he knew what i was thinking the boy said to himself
sample-015677,the boy thanked him ate it and went on his way
sample-015678,the people will enjoy the tea and want to buy the glasses
sample-015679,the alchemist dismounted slowly and the boy did the same
sample-015680,some went away while i was there and other people came
sample-015681,we were in the same outfit
sample-015682,the boy looked around for the ovens and other apparatus used in alchemy but saw none
sample-015684,when the sun sets the men will once again surrender their arms to me
sample-015685,the old man opened his cape and the boy was struck by what he saw
sample-015686,he washed the detritus from his hair
sample-015687,i told him we could teach her to ignore people who waste her time
sample-015688,what are you talking about
sample-015689,the man looked at him without responding
sample-015690,he started to read the book he had bought
sample-015691,only when he himself reveals it
sample-015692,i saw the shopkeeper struggling near the edge of the pit
sample-015693,television can make you dumb but it can also be good education
sample-015694,but he kept the sword in his hand
sample-015695,finally after hours of waiting the guard bade the boy enter
sample-015696,no no thanks just looking
sample-015698,the night was warm and i was thirsty
sample-015699,a frightening concept occured to jennifer
sample-015700,the pixel probabilities are conditioned on the model state
sample-015701,i bet you she'd know how to say it all right
sample-015702,a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder
sample-015703,the top of the cylinder was rotating on its body
sample-015704,it was our money and we want it back
sample-015705,we need to hurry
sample-015706,they jetted off to the bahamas
sample-015707,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
sample-015708,they have gotten used to my being away and so have i
sample-015709,he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
sample-015710,the boy said nothing
sample-015711,i waited all afternoon and evening he said
sample-015712,this wool jumper is itchy
sample-015713,go ahead and have your dinner
sample-015714,he stood irresolute for a moment and then scrambled out of the pit
sample-015715,i'm not taking any more chances
sample-015716,that's only the beginning
sample-015717,it drew a droplet of blood
sample-015718,and it knew nothing about love
sample-015719,every search begins with beginner's luck
sample-015720,the old man knew how to read and had already read the book
sample-015721,why did you want to see me the boy asked
sample-015722,to do that successfully i must have no fear of failure
sample-015723,the old man wore a breastplate of heavy gold covered with precious stones
sample-015724,the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
sample-015725,everyone seemed very excited
sample-015726,you can't be the wind the wind said
sample-015727,as he did so he talked with the monk about the tribal wars
sample-015728,you gave them everything i had the boy said
sample-015729,he arose and taking up his crook began to awaken the sheep that still slept
sample-015730,he had tried in vain to establish a relationship with an alchemist
sample-015731,the horseman was completely immobile as was the boy
sample-015732,he had studied latin spanish and theology
sample-015733,the same book that taught me about urim and thummim
sample-015734,i'll never get this speech right
sample-015735,they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
sample-015736,it was not clear who had the right of way since the traffic lights were off
sample-015737,and they attacked an empty tent
sample-015738,the owner of the bar came over and looked as well
sample-015739,most meteorites are more or less rounded
sample-015748,then like a colony of worker ants they dismantled their stalls and left
sample-015749,but then i realized she couldn't have been
sample-015758,the camel drivers exchanged information about windstorms and told stories about the desert
sample-015759,look at the policy i gave him
sample-015760,some went away while i was there and other people came
sample-015761,i saw a young man standing on the cylinder and trying to scramble out of the hole again
sample-015762,i want to pay for my drink
sample-015763,the crowd swayed a little as i elbowed my way through
sample-015764,it required no explanation just as the universe needs none as it travels through endless time
sample-015765,how about once more around the park
sample-015766,no one said a word as the old man continued
sample-015767,i have already found my treasure
sample-015770,i'll tell you in a minute
sample-015771,for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
sample-015772,i don't want to change anything because i don't know how to deal with change
sample-015773,the man looked at him without responding
sample-015774,the caravan would be very lucky to reach the oasis
sample-015775,i think it's marvelous
sample-015776,the model has effectively three fully connected layers
sample-015777,when he speaks in our language i can interpret what he has said
sample-015788,so the wind blew with all its strength and the sky was filled with sand
sample-015789,the boy promised himself that when he returned from egypt he would buy that sword
sample-015798,the top had certainly ceased to rotate
sample-015799,whatever the thing observed one could find a connection with his experience of the moment
sample-015808,now i can see that it hasn't been too bad
sample-015809,i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit
sample-015818,just tell them marge sent you
sample-015819,it would have been visible to me had i only looked up as it passed
sample-015820,henderson went into the railway station to telegraph the news to london
sample-015821,well interpret the dream he said
sample-015822,these trousers don't fit very well
sample-015823,how come you speak spanish he asked
sample-015824,and he wasn't faring much better
sample-015825,there was a fluctuation in the water pressure that fed the whale tank
sample-015826,you are almost at the end of your journey said the alchemist
sample-015827,the alchemist was a bit daunting but as the boy drank the wine he relaxed
sample-015830,he's had sniffles all day
sample-015831,they're not my sheep anymore he said to himself without nostalgia
sample-015832,when he emerged it was with a young arab dressed in white and gold
sample-015833,then suddenly they kneel and die
sample-015834,i have the diet of a kid who found twenty dollars
sample-015835,hires two personal trainers and make one of them train the other one
sample-015836,no the alchemist answered
sample-015837,he came to understand its dodges and tricks and to accept it as it was
sample-015840,where are we going to put him
sample-015841,we could get to the pyramids by tomorrow said the other taking the money
sample-015842,it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-015843,mary told me that she got to meet up with you while she was back in san francisco
sample-015844,and tomorrow his enemy would also be a part of that soul
sample-015845,and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
sample-015846,he wants me to write down only things that i think about but not things i plan to do
sample-015847,let's get out of here said the new arrival
sample-015848,and a whole cold chicken staring us right in the face
sample-015849,am i going to find my treasure he asked
sample-015850,about eleven i walked back to my home in maybury because nothing seemed to be happening
sample-015851,he picked up the two stones and put them back in his pouch
sample-015852,too young or too old
sample-015853,he hoped that it would be someone as capable as his previous apprentice
sample-015854,and it knew nothing about love
sample-015855,it was more activity than usual for this time of the morning
sample-015856,that's never happened to me the boy said
sample-015857,what's the matter with eleanor
sample-015858,want someone to take you home
sample-015859,some went away while i was there and other people came
sample-015860,he became friendly with the camel driver who traveled alongside him
sample-015861,as was mecca for the merchant
sample-015862,the englishman had been profoundly impressed by the story
sample-015863,the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
sample-015864,the englishman's eyes lit up
sample-015865,last week our fridge broke which forced us to eat lots of ice cream
sample-015866,they rode for the entire day
sample-015868,a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder
sample-015869,that couldn't be one of the matthew boys
sample-015870,but would you mind telling me who goes out
sample-015871,tell me more about your dream said the woman
sample-015872,sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
sample-015873,hires two personal trainers and make one of them train the other one
sample-015874,several figures approached him
sample-015875,they're not for sale he said
sample-015876,the boy thought it a strange question
sample-015877,full steam ahead said the captain
sample-015878,you've got about two minutes
sample-015879,and it knew nothing about love
sample-015880,a large piece suddenly came off and fell with a loud and sharp noise
sample-015881,it was glaringly hot not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind
sample-015882,they placed the symbols of the pilgrimage on the doors of their houses
sample-015883,the only things that concerned the sheep were food and water
sample-015884,it's almost as if he had been here and left his mark he thought
sample-015885,how can you have any happiness after that
sample-015886,let's go and have some lunch said the crystal merchant
sample-015887,the python wasn't a snake it was a programming language
sample-015888,but there's a tribal war the boy reiterated
sample-015889,because you have already lost your savings twice
sample-015890,i was scared but wasted no time in going out and crossing the bridge to the sand pits
sample-015891,it helped me to trust in people the englishman answered
sample-015892,it was bunched up and he had hardly thought of it for a long time
sample-015893,the boy didn't say anything
sample-015894,there were raised voicesand some sort of struggle appeared to be going on 
sample-015895,what should we give him
sample-015896,she keeps saying that she has no regrets about moving back home but im not sure if its entirely true
sample-015897,you will never reopen
sample-015899,the shop was busy and the man asked the shepherd to wait until the afternoon
sample-015900,that's the principle that governs all things he said
sample-015901,the only things that concerned the sheep were food and water
sample-015902,michael opened a browser and navigated to an anonymous search engine
sample-015903,it was however still so hot from its flight through the air
sample-015904,i'm not supposed to tell
sample-015905,i'm a lot closer to being able to do a pullup than i realized
sample-015906,be careful with your prognostications said the stranger
sample-015907,imagine if everyone went around transforming lead into gold
sample-015908,the englishman was disappointed
sample-015909,the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
sample-015910,they shouted consolation and promises and went off back to the town again to get help
sample-015911,your behavior is embarrassing go learn the art of social intercourse
sample-015912,the tide rushed into the estuary at a menacing pace
sample-015913,i thought you were asleep
sample-015914,the wind screamed with delight and blew harder than ever
sample-015915,who wrote that speech for you
sample-015916,i remember grandpa paul looking through it
sample-015917,and they attacked an empty tent
sample-015918,i don't know why
sample-015919,it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
sample-015920,he was tense and upset because he knew that the old man was right
sample-015921,the diver forced open the oyster revealing a shimmering pearl
sample-015922,what's your name he asked
sample-015923,maybe he'll give us one
sample-015924,they raise their glasses
sample-015925,the old man wore a breastplate of heavy gold covered with precious stones
sample-015926,the angel touched the man's shoulder and they were both projected far into the future
sample-015927,the boy continued to listen to his heart as they crossed the desert
sample-015928,i heard a faint movement under my feet
sample-015929,they might even have become friends but the englishman closed off the conversation
sample-015930,then he turned to the boy this time his expression was cold and distant
sample-015931,then he dropped his spade picked up his jacket and came out into the road
sample-015932,everyone seemed very excited
sample-015933,the closer he got to the realization of his dream the more difficult things became
sample-015934,get the riot gear
sample-015935,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
sample-015936,we heard a lot of yelling
sample-015937,there was enough there to buy a lot of weapons
sample-015938,but he decided first to buy his bakery and put some money aside
sample-015939,that he had attended a seminary until he was sixteen
sample-015940,the wind's curiosity was aroused something that had never happened before
sample-015941,then came the night of the first falling star
sample-015942,then came the night of the first falling star
sample-015943,and you ought to read more about the world answered the englishman
sample-015944,i'm going to them
sample-015945,at the same time they cannot find an exact definition of what a feeling is
sample-015946,he stood irresolute for a moment and then scrambled out of the pit
sample-015947,they returned to the gates of the monastery
sample-015950,then suppose you give me the money
sample-015951,the guy thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to stop him
sample-015952,there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
sample-015953,air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
sample-015954,but i found it difficult to get to work because of the investigations
sample-015955,so we their hearts speak more and more softly
sample-015956,people that never had to worry
sample-015957,his father said no more
sample-015968,i can't let her out
sample-015969,it picks up on the mike
sample-015978,she saved the lives of every man on that transport
sample-015979,i have known true alchemists the alchemist continued
sample-015980,finally a young woman approached who was not dressed in black
sample-015981,the boy felt a pang in his heart thinking about the merchant's daughter
sample-015982,what are they wearing now
sample-015983,want to know what it is
sample-015984,we lit the lantern and walked over to his house
sample-015985,he stood irresolute for a moment and then scrambled out of the pit
sample-015986,sometimes it's better to be with the sheep who don't say anything
sample-015987,the snake fought frantically making hissing sounds that shattered the silence of the desert
sample-015990,it brought his heart into his mouth
sample-015991,a shepherd may like to travel but he should never forget about his sheep
sample-015992,he called to the boy and they took a walk along the dunes surrounding the encampment
sample-015993,some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound
sample-015994,out of the mouths of babes
sample-015995,the burning fire had been extinguished
sample-015996,don't you know that girl's very sick
sample-015997,it is always nice to hear that your presence is appreciated
sample-016000,i should thank you
sample-016001,but she said nothing
sample-016002,during the third year the omens will continue to speak of your treasure and your destiny
sample-016003,the boy fell to the sand nearly unconscious
sample-016004,it seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of here
sample-016005,that's true the boy thought
sample-016006,maybe tomorrow said the boy moving away
sample-016007,just a memory right now it signified shade water and a refuge from the war
sample-016008,i wished i had a light to smoke by
sample-016009,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
sample-016010,it was starlight and i explained the signs of the zodiac to her
sample-016011,the alchemist probably already knew all that
sample-016012,it seemed so safe and tranquil
sample-016013,he got up early with the idea of finding it
sample-016014,the boy was surprised
sample-016015,i'm the leader of the caravan said a darkeyed bearded man
sample-016016,they jumped out of the window
sample-016017,please never throw salami pizza away
sample-016018,had our instruments permitted it we might have been able to see the trouble way back when
sample-016019,toward the end of the afternoon they came upon a coptic monastery
sample-016020,just by looking at them
sample-016021,the newspaper articles had prepared everyone for the reception of the idea
sample-016022,a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder
sample-016023,because i don't live in either my past or my future
sample-016024,drop the whole business quickly
sample-016025,my name is melchizedek said the old man
sample-016026,like eating or sleeping or like seeking love or finding a job
sample-016027,you don't have to be rich skinny popular or even own a cape to perform a random act of kindness
sample-016028,the caravans had been stopped at giza for some time waiting for the wars to end
sample-016029,so how will we name all these hurricanes
sample-016030,the tired paramedic handed over his patient for surgery
sample-016031,but i'm liable to get into a jam
sample-016032,but the marketplace was empty and he was far from home so he wept
sample-016033,can you imagine bumping into a load of cops
sample-016034,then he realized that he had been distracted for a few moments looking at the sword
sample-016035,the burning fire had been extinguished
sample-016036,fill this place with a sandstorm so strong that it blots out the sun
sample-016037,so he could not be hasty nor impatient
sample-016038,his hands began to tremble and the woman sensed it
sample-016039,some of the grey ash was falling off the circular edge
sample-016040,it must have fallen while i was sitting over there
sample-016041,this morning i found a calculator taped to my wii
sample-016042,i just don't trust anyone who says they've never had hamburger helper
sample-016043,still after that first million before you're thirty
sample-016044,as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
sample-016045,i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
sample-016046,then he turned to the boy this time his expression was cold and distant
sample-016047,maybe we're all that way the boy mused
sample-016050,she composed an emotional song in her bedroom
sample-016051,that's where you're mistaken
sample-016052,the boy went to look for the englishman
sample-016053,he paid for the wool and asked the shepherd to come back the following year
sample-016054,i won't ever tell a soul
sample-016055,a monk dressed in black came to the gates
sample-016056,a large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered
sample-016057,some went away while i was there and other people came
sample-016068,and maybe it wasn't that they were teaching me but that i was learning from them
sample-016069,then he turned to the boy
sample-016078,i have had the same dream twice he said
sample-016079,night fell and an assortment of fighting men and merchants entered and exited the tent
sample-016080,you can't do that
sample-016081,rachid said he likes pineapple for breakfast
sample-016082,at once he connected the two incidents
sample-016083,some storms are worth the wreckage
sample-016084,i'm your guardian angel
sample-016085,people saw me coming and welcomed me he thought
sample-016086,to nourish the falcon
sample-016087,heads popping back behind doors
sample-016090,that's where i'm going
sample-016091,but that was simply because my eye was tired
sample-016092,help my friend mr richard
sample-016093,look at it today
sample-016094,in those days very few of the people had any idea about astronomy
sample-016095,but i didnt think that it contained any living creature
sample-016096,he was already re accustomed to desert's silence
sample-016097,sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
sample-016108,the boy began to dig into the dune
sample-016109,it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-016118,so what is salem like he asked trying to get some sort of clue
sample-016119,relaxed and unhurried he resolved that he would walk through the narrow streets of tangier
sample-016120,don't you know me
sample-016121,it was faintly marked with transverse stripes and slightly flattened from the perfect round
sample-016122,he was about the same age and height as the boy
sample-016123,the twelve dollars includes everything
sample-016124,they were strange books
sample-016125,the boy was getting irritated
sample-016126,java is not only an island but also a popular programming language
sample-016127,there's one that says 'everything that happens once can never happen again
sample-016130,the level ground was blackened as far as one could see and it was still giving off smoke
sample-016131,it doesn't matter he said to his sheep
sample-016132,the idea is still good
sample-016133,the land was ruined and i had to find some other way to earn a living
sample-016134,everybody quiet and ready for an emergency
sample-016135,people said that gypsies spent their lives tricking others
sample-016136,then suddenly he noticed it with a start
sample-016137,it is true that some methods benefit from normalization of image inputs
sample-016140,it didn't bring with it the smell of the desert nor the threat of moorish invasion
sample-016141,he almost began to tell about his treasure but decided not to do so
sample-016142,let me tell you what will happen
sample-016143,but this payment goes well beyond my generosity the monk responded
sample-016144,this is no time to give up
sample-016145,they locked themselves in their laboratories and tried to evolve as gold had
sample-016146,it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
sample-016147,this samantha tommy movement costs you a fortune
sample-016148,i have come to enquire about the antelope
sample-016149,you must always know what it is that you want the old king had said
sample-016150,if what one finds is made of pure matter it will never spoil
sample-016151,with the wars between the tribes it's impossible to cross the desert
sample-016152,at night they spread their sleeping gear and kept their fires hidden
sample-016153,who are you he heard a voice ask him in spanish
sample-016154,we always observe the tradition
sample-016155,if i had told you you wouldn't have seen the pyramids
sample-016156,so how will we name all these hurricanes
sample-016157,looks like she can keep kathy's on her toes
sample-016158,pierre decided to research gay culture
sample-016159,but i found it difficult to get to work because of the investigations
sample-016160,worked hard just to have food and water like the sheep
sample-016161,and the murmur lasted longer than a simple vow would have
sample-016162,because you have already lost your savings twice
sample-016163,at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars
sample-016164,as they sat down at the only table in the place the crystal merchant laughed
sample-016165,a large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered
sample-016166,coming home a party of tourists passed us singing and playing music
sample-016167,that's what i was sent down for
sample-016168,you can hear out of it
sample-016169,maybe that's why they always stay close to me
sample-016170,one is loved because one is loved
sample-016171,the night was warm and i was thirsty
sample-016172,you gave them everything i had the boy said
sample-016173,that wasn't at all necessary
sample-016174,all they ever do really is look for food and water
sample-016175,why the shots stopped after the tenth no one on earth has tried to explain
sample-016176,he had tried in vain to establish a relationship with an alchemist
sample-016177,but i felt miserable watching him wither away like a shriveled dandelion
sample-016178,a part of me is also trying to come to terms with the fact that i won't be able to travel as much anymore
sample-016179,you're the biggest person in town
sample-016180,if you have to wait until the war is over then wait
sample-016181,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
sample-016182,i want to do what i want to do
sample-016183,don't you know me
sample-016184,it almost retained its shape
sample-016185,the sun was turned into a golden disk
sample-016186,anything i can do back here
sample-016187,we heard a lot of yelling
sample-016188,some went away while i was there and other people came
sample-016189,if you're looking for a room there's no vacancy
sample-016190,only when he himself reveals it
sample-016191,and maybe it wasn't that they were teaching me but that i was learning from them
sample-016192,a line of flame high can be seen in the atmosphere
sample-016193,you should see the other guy specifically how good at fighting he is
sample-016194,maybe i will say it
sample-016195,absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
sample-016196,i can't very well leave without a pair of water wings
sample-016197,the boy was suddenly happy to be there at the warehouse
sample-016198,the crowd swayed a little as i elbowed my way through
sample-016199,you could have married anybody else in town
sample-016200,their faces were hidden behind blue veils with only their eyes showing
sample-016201,it seemed he had made the long journey for nothing
sample-016202,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
sample-016203,since then i haven't been able to get another one
sample-016204,but there was a sixth day the sun went on
sample-016205,he really was a king
sample-016206,they wanted to save the oasis
sample-016207,the morning post just turned shelly eric over to the sheriff
sample-016208,oh yes you do
sample-016209,i want to tell you a story about dreams said the alchemist
sample-016210,i should have repeated it for him
sample-016211,which one of these men is it
sample-016212,this wasn't a strange place it was a new one
sample-016213,it brought his heart into his mouth
sample-016214,but they could never have taught him arabic
sample-016215,i understand that it is your dataset and that it is new
sample-016216,whenever he could he sought out a new road to travel
sample-016217,an army is coming the boy said
sample-016218,he must be disguised to avoid encounters with thieves
sample-016219,your husband must have been in a great hurry
sample-016220,now wait a minute
sample-016221,perhaps she forgot all about it
sample-016222,he had understood the story the old king had told him
sample-016223,i was scared but wasted no time in going out and crossing the bridge to the sand pits
sample-016224,how often do you want to eat
sample-016225,hey dj play the top one hundred tracks
sample-016226,the martinis cross themselves
sample-016227,try it again
sample-016228,they found a cactus in a passenger's luggage at the airport's security check
sample-016229,i don't care what happens to me
sample-016230,i don't care what you charge them with
sample-016231,but finally he agreed that the boy who spoke better arabic than he should do so
sample-016232,it helped me to trust in people the englishman answered
sample-016233,he condemned the commander to death without honor
sample-016234,what is a foreigner doing here asked another of the men
sample-016235,they have gotten used to my being away and so have i
sample-016236,and above all don't forget to follow your destiny through to its conclusion
sample-016237,the boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid responding to her question
sample-016238,the caravans had been stopped at giza for some time waiting for the wars to end
sample-016239,he just got a new kite for his birthday
sample-016240,he couldn't have been wrong
sample-016241,at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
sample-016242,they're only made of rock crystal and there are millions of rock crystals in the earth
sample-016243,but don't worry the alchemist continued
sample-016244,is it a deal or isn't it
sample-016245,he became friendly with the camel driver who traveled alongside him
sample-016246,he transformed himself into a stone that rolled up to the miner's foot
sample-016247,the wind began to pick up
sample-016250,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
sample-016251,lots of places sell tea around here the merchant said
sample-016252,because now he knew where his treasure was
sample-016253,i recovered myself and continued the walk home
sample-016254,which one is mine
sample-016255,what do you need
sample-016256,the strange horseman drew an enormous curved sword from a scabbard mounted on his saddle
sample-016257,from there he could see africa in the distance
sample-016268,we speak of them only to children
sample-016269,sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
sample-016278,tangier is not like the rest of africa
sample-016279,she had her cardigan on
sample-016280,dense clouds of smoke or dust can be seen through a powerful telescope
sample-016281,before this i always looked to the desert with longing said fatima
sample-016282,close shot of the colonel
sample-016283,why do you want to find that sort of person the arab asked
sample-016284,even then he hardly understood what this meant
sample-016285,there's nobody else on the paper who can write
sample-016286,they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
sample-016287,i heard a faint movement under my feet
sample-016290,haven't you even started
sample-016291,he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
sample-016292,fatima was more important than his treasure
sample-016293,what's the good of arguing about something that probably doesn't exist
sample-016294,the old man knew how to read and had already read the book
sample-016295,i thought that someday i'd be rich and could go to mecca
sample-016296,i'm ok if you're ok about it
sample-016297,rest well tonight as if you were a warrior preparing for combat
sample-016308,you'll have to wake him up
sample-016309,maybe that's why they came
sample-016318,this desert was once a sea he said
sample-016319,now let's see what you look like when you protest
sample-016320,one day the earth began to tremble and the nile overflowed its banks
sample-016321,go and speak to the tribal chieftains said the camel driver
sample-016322,the boy had met the alchemist
sample-016323,relaxed and unhurried he resolved that he would walk through the narrow streets of tangier
sample-016324,get martin out of jail
sample-016325,we miss you and miss having a friend like you and i am so happy that you two got to catch up
sample-016326,his expression reminded me of a horse chewing hay
sample-016327,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
sample-016330,i wonder if ernie's still here with his taxicab
sample-016331,and the names of the people involved were very difficult to pronounce
sample-016332,it was a cobra whose venom could kill a person in minutes
sample-016333,no the alchemist answered
sample-016334,the boy had met the alchemist
sample-016335,i guess i'm just upset about all this
sample-016336,at once he connected the two incidents
sample-016337,who'd you say it was
sample-016340,you mean you don't approve of my having a baby
sample-016341,i can interpret it but the interpretation is very difficult
sample-016342,they're only made of rock crystal and there are millions of rock crystals in the earth
sample-016343,the following night the boy appeared at the alchemist's tent with a horse
sample-016344,it's doubled our circulation
sample-016345,he recited an our father silently
sample-016346,when i returned to the common the sun was setting
sample-016347,the englishman was disappointed
sample-016348,and they found the watch on him
sample-016350,there were raised voicesand some sort of struggle appeared to be going on 
sample-016351,it was just ripe enough to eat
sample-016352,his death is registered with the war department in washington
sample-016353,never give up
sample-016354,there was nothing to hold him back except himself
sample-016355,there was no way to measure anything of that length
sample-016356,the burning fire had been extinguished
sample-016357,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
sample-016358,he had never imagined that questions about life would be of such importance to a shepherd
sample-016359,but those who know about such things would know that those are urim and thummim
sample-016360,show me some gratitude
sample-016362,i want to tell you a story about dreams said the alchemist
sample-016363,merry christmas my dears
sample-016364,he was already re accustomed to desert's silence
sample-016365,is sam with you
sample-016366,you like every boy
sample-016367,lots of places sell tea around here the merchant said
sample-016368,you have told me about your dreams about the old king and your treasure
sample-016369,he just got a new kite for his birthday
sample-016370,three days from now he would be with the merchant's daughter
sample-016371,he found the toilet occupied
sample-016372,we're refugees from the tribal wars and we need money the other figure said
sample-016373,she'll see us through dinner
sample-016374,earlier this year we found a really nice place near my office and we moved in together
sample-016376,you old sorcerer the boy shouted up to the sky
sample-016377,they don't see that the fields are new and the seasons change
sample-016378,dusk was falling as the boy arrived with his herd at an abandoned church
sample-016379,he believed in omens
sample-016380,there was a general movement backwards
sample-016381,he was so ashamed that he wanted to cry
sample-016382,you're a week late for school already
sample-016383,the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
sample-016384,what do you want me to do
sample-016385,there are powerful forces on both sides and the war is important to both armies
sample-016386,what was spoken was totally disregarded
sample-016387,coming home a party of tourists passed us singing and playing music
sample-016388,but i found it difficult to get to work because of the investigations
sample-016389,just by looking at them
sample-016390,then it became a signal of danger
sample-016391,you've got the brain of a pancake
sample-016392,in those days very few of the people had any idea about astronomy
sample-016393,the heat lasted until nightfall and all that time he had to carry his jacket
sample-016394,get me a pitcher's glove
sample-016395,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
sample-016396,arabs often appeared in the city shopping and chanting their strange prayers several times a day
sample-016397,he condemned the commander to death without honor
sample-016398,i dont mind working from home most of the time but i do miss having coworkers
sample-016399,ogilvy watched till one and then gave up
sample-016400,he doesn't have anything else
sample-016401,whenever he saw the sea or a fire he fell silent impressed by their elemental force
sample-016402,the night was warm and i was thirsty
sample-016403,he had come to the town only to find a woman who could interpret his dream
sample-016404,on the following day the first clear sign of danger appeared
sample-016405,who is it from
sample-016406,he remembered what the old man had said about offering something you didn't even have yet
sample-016408,the boy remembered his dream and suddenly everything was clear to him
sample-016409,they might even have become friends but the englishman closed off the conversation
sample-016410,the levanter increased in intensity
sample-016411,it's called the principle of favorability
sample-016412,eighteen of us couldn't move the van
sample-016414,who'll keep the lamp in the window for you
sample-016415,he wanted your money he said
sample-016416,a crowd of people stood around the fountain
sample-016417,what am i going to say to elvis
sample-016418,and one can always come back
sample-016419,there were just drawings coded instructions and obscure texts
sample-016420,you'd better start right now
sample-016421,i'm not going very far the alchemist answered looking straight into the eyes of the horsemen
sample-016422,you can't go any farther one of them said
sample-016423,you'd lie about anything
sample-016424,it's even higher than this
sample-016425,the boy felt a pang in his heart thinking about the merchant's daughter
sample-016426,evaluation should be extended to other datasets
sample-016427,i'm going with you the boy said
sample-016428,he wanted your money he said
sample-016429,yet it was a little too large for assurance
sample-016430,keep trying hard
sample-016431,the soul of the world is nourished by people's happiness
sample-016432,can't you just observe men and omens in order to understand the language the boy asked
sample-016433,as he was attempting to pull out the rocks he encountered he heard footsteps
sample-016434,the heather was on fire and you could see a thin blue smoke rising up slowly
sample-016435,it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience
sample-016436,that's why i'm here in the middle of het desert
sample-016437,tonight we give you something entirely new and different
sample-016438,first they tried to find him on their own
sample-016439,the man looked at him without responding
sample-016440,you keep out of this
sample-016441,i know he wrote them on account of the misspellings
sample-016442,three cheers for aden christopher
sample-016443,uncle jack and i are going to miss you
sample-016444,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
sample-016445,the wind began to pick up
sample-016446,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
sample-016447,melchizedek watched a small ship that was plowing its way out of the port
sample-016450,there's nothing wrong with the books
sample-016451,then the old man began to inspect the sheep and he saw that one was lame
sample-016452,some went away while i was there and other people came
sample-016453,from here on you will be alone the alchemist said
sample-016454,every folder contained a photo
sample-016455,strange images passed through my mind
sample-016456,some of the grey ash was falling off the circular edge
sample-016457,this is for you
sample-016468,mosquitoes are annoying in the summer and can even transmit illnesses
sample-016469,you've got something on your mind
sample-016478,the solution i've described is to use windows as your host and linux as your guest
sample-016479,that day he didn't make a cast
sample-016480,you're the one who may die the alchemist said
sample-016481,you did a swell job
sample-016482,yeah i like that
sample-016483,but i never said anything like that
sample-016484,i just don't trust anyone who says they've never had hamburger helper
sample-016485,take your card and leave it with him
sample-016486,they were relieved and happy
sample-016487,a large piece suddenly came off and fell with a loud and sharp noise
sample-016490,i want my wife
sample-016491,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
sample-016492,but that's why you created the game in the first place the boy answered
sample-016493,go to this address
sample-016494,the boy wanted to believe that his friend had simply become separated from him by accident
sample-016495,in alchemy it's called the soul of the world
sample-016496,and seizing the boy's bag the alchemist gave the gold coins to the chief
sample-016497,but the englishman appeared not to attach any importance to it
sample-016508,it is still a phenomenal movement
sample-016509,he wasn't asking for help
sample-016518,this requires a little thought here
sample-016519,my friend bought all the other sheep immediately
sample-016520,i thought that someday i'd be rich and could go to mecca
sample-016521,now you listen to me
sample-016522,but now the sounds inside had stopped
sample-016523,no he's loyal
sample-016524,i'm the answer to your prayer
sample-016525,i'm surprised the boy said
sample-016526,the omens had told him so
sample-016527,what had been next to him five minutes ago was now at the other side
sample-016530,they dismounted and the alchemist said nothing
sample-016531,listen to your heart
sample-016532,sending a gunman to kidnap me
sample-016533,he was planning as he left the bar
sample-016534,the families will be here soon
sample-016535,he paused for a moment to see if the woman knew what the egyptian pyramids were
sample-016536,you're probably weak from hunger
sample-016537,the sun thought for a minute
sample-016540,i sold crystal and crossed the desert
sample-016541,the huge advantage of nx is that it supports rootless mode
sample-016542,you can't believe it's not butter
sample-016543,he thought that with some patience he'd be able to transform everything into gold
sample-016544,and the odor of the animals became a bit more tolerable
sample-016545,and i still claim i was right the night i proposed
sample-016546,they have gotten used to my being away and so have i
sample-016547,the alchemist stopped abruptly and bent to the ground
sample-016548,they filled three sacks
sample-016549,the alchemist followed as the boy's horse ran for almost half an hour
sample-016550,i have been waiting for you here at this oasis for a long time
sample-016551,he believed in omens
sample-016552,some do come back
sample-016553,i'm in a drugstore
sample-016554,he stuck his hand into the pouch and felt around for one of the stones
sample-016555,and the odor of the animals became a bit more tolerable
sample-016556,if we can navigate to each of these quickly we can jump to anywhere quickly
sample-016557,the englishman was disappointed
sample-016558,there was very little talking
sample-016559,absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
sample-016560,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
sample-016561,i think i will
sample-016562,fifty cents on the dollar
sample-016563,it was starlight and i explained the signs of the zodiac to her
sample-016564,i looked at the cylinder again and was completely terrified
sample-016565,you're worth your weight in gold
sample-016566,that sobered him a little
sample-016567,it is i the boy answered
sample-016568,i don't know the desert that well yet
sample-016569,now i want to ask you fellows a couple of questions
sample-016570,'m all about those invisible cosmic connections that transcend time and distance
sample-016571,and the alchemist understood that the boy's heart had returned to the soul of the world
sample-016572,i need you to be spontaneous he asked me out to din din
sample-016573,but the merchant understood what the boy had said
sample-016574,two physicists pondered their revised quantum field theory together
sample-016575,stop treating me like a child
sample-016576,i beg your pardon
sample-016577,their faces were covered with the blue cloths and their eyes showed fear
sample-016578,everything you need to know you have learned through your journey
sample-016579,but i didnt think that it contained any living creature
sample-016580,when the lead had become liquid the alchemist took from his pouch the strange yellow egg
sample-016581,i went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the dark
sample-016582,you're doing a great job so far
sample-016583,i'm going to them
sample-016584,i think jamie did it
sample-016585,i'm going to them
sample-016586,he could see that the old man wanted to know more about his life
sample-016587,the boy brought his horse closer
sample-016588,there were just drawings coded instructions and obscure texts
sample-016589,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
sample-016590,he knew all the fields and pastures of andalusia
sample-016591,there are powerful forces on both sides and the war is important to both armies
sample-016592,don't give us that ethics stuff
sample-016593,what had been next to him five minutes ago was now at the other side
sample-016594,but i found it difficult to get to work because of the investigations
sample-016595,this morning i found a calculator taped to my wii
sample-016596,one of my best reporters
sample-016597,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
sample-016598,it spread through the planet's atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features
sample-016599,i never had any such idea
sample-016600,where is the treasure he asked
sample-016601,i've never had one before the merchant answered
sample-016602,most of my friends have already finished college
sample-016603,it's a dream in the language of the world she said
sample-016604,no wonder this vanilla yogurt tastes disgusting its eatby date was last year
sample-016605,because of the omens the alchemist answered
sample-016606,the two men hurried back and found the cylinder still lying in the same position
sample-016607,as they moved along the boy tried to listen to his heart
sample-016608,camels are traitorous they walk thousands of paces and never seem to tire
sample-016609,the same hand that had brandished the sword now held a whip
sample-016610,he was shaken into wakefulness by someone
sample-016611,i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
sample-016612,the heat lasted until nightfall and all that time he had to carry his jacket
sample-016613,i think its too overwhelming to introduce two complex tools that basically do the same things
sample-016614,and in that mood he was grateful to be in love
sample-016615,the omens will begin insistently to speak of it and you'll try to ignore them
sample-016616,the ashtray was empty
sample-016617,get me a pitcher's glove
sample-016618,looking at the sun he calculated that he would reach tarifa before midday
sample-016619,but i didn't kill anybody
sample-016620,it's what you have always wanted to accomplish
sample-016621,all the joy he had seen that morning had suddenly disappeared
sample-016622,she spoke swedish he spoke spanish
sample-016623,i want to talk to both of you
sample-016624,i'm never more aware of a room's acoustics than when i'm trying to enjoy a snack i have no intention of sharing
sample-016625,the five french tourists stepped over the excited bulldogs
sample-016626,speak to the hand that wrote all said the sun
sample-016627,the boy didn't say anything
sample-016628,they never found the secret
sample-016629,i have to find a man who knows that universal language
sample-016630,but as he saw them lying there on the ground another phrase came to his mind
sample-016631,i'm going to them
sample-016632,then came the night of the first falling star
sample-016633,as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
sample-016634,from atop its walls one can catch a glimpse of africa
sample-016635,wait till you try to turn around
sample-016636,why didn't they wake me
sample-016637,maybe that's why they give up on it so early too
sample-016638,i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
sample-016639,dusk was falling as the boy arrived with his herd at an abandoned church
sample-016640,you're a smart young woman
sample-016641,i'm not very good at this
sample-016642,the alchemist removed the pan from the fire and set it aside to cool
sample-016643,i've just sworn in four hundred deputies
sample-016644,he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
sample-016645,they shouted consolation and promises and went off back to the town again to get help
sample-016646,that guy over there likes to drink a lot talk a lot but do nothing
sample-016647,if it were he would already have heard of it
sample-016650,as he looked at the stones he felt relieved for some reason
sample-016651,two days later the merchant spoke to the boy about the display
sample-016652,the stranger was speaking of things that very few people knew about
sample-016653,the drawer was stuck closed
sample-016654,everyone has his or her own way of learning things he said to himself
sample-016655,he had seen the shooting star and was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere nearby
sample-016656,should i understand the emerald tablet the boy asked
sample-016657,you shouldn't be here the alchemist answered
sample-016668,i'm never more aware of a room's acoustics than when i'm trying to enjoy a snack i have no intention of sharing
sample-016669,that sobered him a little
sample-016678,she supports a mother and two kids
sample-016679,i didn't do anything
sample-016680,the other son was a poet and delighted all of rome with his beautiful verses
sample-016681,i wished i had a light to smoke by
sample-016682,the old man leafed through the book and fell to reading a page he came to
sample-016683,why the shots stopped after the tenth no one on earth has tried to explain
sample-016684,evidently we're the floor show
sample-016685,don't try to enter into the life of the oasis
sample-016686,so how will we name all these hurricanes
sample-016687,i've got a mother and two kid sisters to care for
sample-016690,i recovered myself and continued the walk home
sample-016691,others stumbled upon the stone by accident
sample-016692,this guy stole my watch
sample-016693,we're a different world
sample-016694,what about this job
sample-016695,it was the first time either had touched the other
sample-016696,go into your dance
sample-016697,it's what you have always wanted to accomplish
sample-016708,ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
sample-016709,for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
sample-016718,let's go and have some lunch said the crystal merchant
sample-016719,who is it from
sample-016720,i'll be right with you
sample-016721,she would never know the difference because she didn't know how to read
sample-016722,i tried to understand the proposed application of to the best of my ability
sample-016723,when he's an old man he's going to spend a month in africa
sample-016724,i'm on the job
sample-016725,and he knew that egypt was in africa
sample-016726,a monk dressed in black came to the gates
sample-016727,first they tried to find him on their own
sample-016730,my laptop broke when i dropped it
sample-016731,i should have been there
sample-016732,and about you too
sample-016733,of course the two were unable to do anything
sample-016734,the fact that the two hours had stretched into an entire year didn't matter
sample-016735,you're in luck you two the fat arab said
sample-016736,some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound
sample-016737,even then he hardly understood what this meant
sample-016740,everything has been written by the same hand
sample-016741,maybe the water was too hot
sample-016742,we'll leave tomorrow before sunrise was the alchemist's only response
sample-016743,there's a caravan leaving today for alfayoum
sample-016744,i thought that everything i owned would be destroyed
sample-016745,in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
sample-016746,can i get a woot woot
sample-016747,as fast as i can
sample-016748,see if you can get us seats near the umbrellas
sample-016749,she comes by it naturally
sample-016750,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
sample-016751,coming home a party of tourists passed us singing and playing music
sample-016752,from where i am the sun said i can see the soul of the world
sample-016753,but men began to reject simple things and to write tracts interpretations and philosophical studies
sample-016754,what a terrible thing to say
sample-016755,that he had attended a seminary until he was sixteen
sample-016756,i heard what you were talking about the other day with the alchemist the wind said
sample-016757,but my heart is agitated the boy said
sample-016758,is there a crowd in the street
sample-016759,listen to the woman
sample-016760,if only we could see it
sample-016761,if that guy lays an egg
sample-016762,he moved about invisible but everyone could hear him
sample-016763,you ain't gonna get me to stay here
sample-016764,you skinned him alive
sample-016765,it was a mega monster made of metal
sample-016766,you can't believe it's not butter
sample-016767,he arose and taking up his crook began to awaken the sheep that still slept
sample-016768,because of the omens the alchemist answered
sample-016769,if he makes a buying mistake it doesn't affect him much
sample-016770,don't hurt my finger again
sample-016771,the boy wanted to believe that his friend had simply become separated from him by accident
sample-016772,looking around he sought his sheep and then realized that he was in a new world
sample-016773,are you going to listen
sample-016774,some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound
sample-016775,at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
sample-016776,you'll never get it out of me
sample-016777,feller runs the february months
sample-016778,the terror was palpable
sample-016779,he put his headcloth in place and secured it with a ring made of camel skin
sample-016780,a missing parrot is called a polygon
sample-016781,lindsey promised to call you from new york tonight
sample-016782,i should have repeated it for him
sample-016783,come here a minute
sample-016784,but you are in the desert
sample-016785,but i found it difficult to get to work because of the investigations
sample-016786,looking around he sought his sheep and then realized that he was in a new world
sample-016787,i don't want any part of this thing
sample-016788,then you taught me something of the universal language and the soul of the world
sample-016789,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
sample-016790,he must know how to deal with the snakes of the desert
sample-016791,some storms are worth the wreckage
sample-016792,are there any other questions
sample-016793,he got up early with the idea of finding it
sample-016794,he had seen the shooting star and was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere nearby
sample-016795,he had seen the shooting star and was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere nearby
sample-016796,the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
sample-016797,we want to see you
sample-016798,would you show these gentlemen to the door
sample-016799,his hands began to tremble and the woman sensed it
sample-016800,cause you know how politicians are
sample-016801,there is a universal language understood by everybody but already forgotten
sample-016802,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
sample-016803,eventually the merchant had to hire two more employees
sample-016804,i'm never more aware of a room's acoustics than when i'm trying to enjoy a snack i have no intention of sharing
sample-016805,what tricks would i pull
sample-016806,that's good thought the englishman
sample-016807,it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
sample-016808,but they don't count
sample-016809,they'll never close us up today
sample-016810,it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
sample-016811,nature knows me as the wisest being in creation the sun said
sample-016812,the men were smoking their hookahs and trading stories from the battlefield
sample-016813,now leave us alone said the boy to the young arab
sample-016814,i know she writes them
sample-016815,the boy took them to the cliff where he had been on the previous day
sample-016816,gold would lose its value
sample-016817,she lives in the park
sample-016818,alchemy is a serious discipline
sample-016819,the music was captivating
sample-016820,and the alchemist understood that the boy's heart had returned to the soul of the world
sample-016821,and above all don't forget to follow your destiny through to its conclusion
sample-016822,i can clean up those glasses in the window if you want said the boy
sample-016823,the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
sample-016824,just as your grandfather taught you
sample-016825,what should we give him
sample-016826,the heather was on fire and you could see a thin blue smoke rising up slowly
sample-016827,for users it is important that they can trust their operating system
sample-016828,they placed the symbols of the pilgrimage on the doors of their houses
sample-016829,acne is mainly a problem for teenagers
sample-016830,the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
sample-016831,why can't you be serious
sample-016832,by enumerating the people she wanted to talk with she was calmed
sample-016833,where your treasure is there also will be your heart the alchemist had told him
sample-016834,who told you that asked the boy startled
sample-016835,and ask for a glass of wine for me
sample-016836,the handle snagged my coat
sample-016837,send those other people in
sample-016838,his name was joseph
sample-016839,you were going to go out and conquer the world
sample-016848,gypsies are experts at getting people to do that sighed the old man
sample-016849,there was no way for everybody to know about alchemy
sample-016858,she don't know where laurence is
sample-016859,our religion dictates our actions
sample-016860,he loosened the reins on his horse who galloped forward over the rocks and sand
sample-016861,he began to dig at the base of the sycamore
sample-016862,mecca is a lot farther away than the pyramids
sample-016863,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
sample-016864,i only interpret dreams
sample-016865,the merchant turned to a customer who wanted three crystal glasses
sample-016866,he got up early with the idea of finding it
sample-016867,everyone when they are young knows what their destiny is
sample-016870,if you want something you gotta go get it
sample-016871,but bakers are more important people than shepherds
sample-016872,some went away while i was there and other people came
sample-016873,he had understood the story the old king had told him
sample-016874,the alchemist removed the pan from the fire and set it aside to cool
sample-016875,just you and i
sample-016876,i never saw it before
sample-016877,hundreds must have seen it and taken it for a falling star
sample-016888,look out where you're pointing that gun
sample-016889,don't say that again
sample-016898,they mounted their horses
sample-016899,he had seen the shooting star and was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere nearby
sample-016900,my tax dollars pay for those public school proms
sample-016901,at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars
sample-016902,you said it to me too
sample-016903,they could barely see the boy
sample-016904,there were really i think two or three hundred people elbowing one another
sample-016905,thank you said the boy
sample-016906,everything you need to know you have learned through your journey
sample-016907,then suddenly they kneel and die
sample-016910,he was proud of himself
sample-016911,now let's see what you look like when you protest
sample-016912,he must be disguised to avoid encounters with thieves
sample-016913,that was the law of hospitality
sample-016914,but fatima's hands held to the handles of her jug
sample-016915,you old sorcerer the boy shouted up to the sky
sample-016916,advancing slowly they searched among the stones
sample-016917,scattered groups of people were hurrying from the direction of woking
sample-016928,the boy felt ill and terribly alone
sample-016929,there's a caravan leaving today for alfayoum
sample-016938,the sparrow and the songbird danced along the fence
sample-016939,it has happened many times before
sample-016940,my chinchilla eats bread
sample-016941,scattered groups of people were hurrying from the direction of woking
sample-016942,now it turns out you were only interested in the money
sample-016943,before the boy could reply a butterfly appeared and fluttered between him and the old man
sample-016944,that's a christmas present from a very dear friend of mine
sample-016945,they mounted their horses
sample-016946,how do you know
sample-016947,on the seventh day the alchemist decided to make camp earlier than usual
sample-016948,because the crystal was dirty
sample-016949,the boy offered his bottle hoping that the old man would leave him alone
sample-016950,she has always been very kind and friendly to everyone even strangers
sample-016951,can't you just observe men and omens in order to understand the language the boy asked
sample-016952,it picks up on the mike
sample-016953,he was alarmed by what had happened
sample-016954,and this is for me said the alchemist keeping one of the parts
sample-016955,it was however still so hot from its flight through the air
sample-016956,tonight they would find out the truth
sample-016957,after all what he had always wanted was just that to know new places
sample-016958,she keeps saying that she has no regrets about moving back home but im not sure if its entirely true
sample-016959,it's easy and yet i've never done it before he thought
sample-016960,something bright reflected from his chest with such intensity that the boy was momentarily blinded
sample-016961,lisa why aren't you at the convention
sample-016962,we miss you and miss having a friend like you and i am so happy that you two got to catch up
sample-016963,there was a time when for me a camel's whinnying was nothing more than whinnying
sample-016964,i just don't trust anyone who says they've never had hamburger helper
sample-016965,henderson went into the railway station to telegraph the news to london
sample-016966,the boy observed in silence the progress of the animals and people across the desert
sample-016967,before him was an enormous white horse rearing over him with a frightening scream
sample-016968,everybody quiet and ready for an emergency
sample-016969,when he had completed the cleaning he asked the man for something to eat
sample-016970,the boy had noticed that the englishman was irritable and missed his books
sample-016971,you're supposed to be a smart guy
sample-016972,that he had attended a seminary until he was sixteen
sample-016973,'m all about those invisible cosmic connections that transcend time and distance
sample-016974,but horses tire bit by bit
sample-016975,so what do you want of me the sun asked
sample-016976,it was the time of day when all of spain slept during the summer
sample-016977,our new ai can dynamically adapt the balance of the gameplay
sample-016978,i lost my wallet
sample-016979,why did you want to see me the boy asked
sample-016980,well he thought about that the old man said
sample-016981,gmo are ruining our crops
sample-016982,wait till martha hears about this
sample-016983,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
sample-016984,get this car out of here
sample-016985,but the boy was certain that he had been looking at them
sample-016986,they say this is not good
sample-016987,so what do you want of me the sun asked
sample-016988,every day was there to be lived or to mark one's departure from this world
sample-016989,it's for annabelle
sample-016990,she told me she feels hopeful and optimistic
sample-016991,it was faintly marked with transverse stripes and slightly flattened from the perfect round
sample-016992,there were really i think two or three hundred people elbowing one another
sample-016993,just teach me to be the wind for a few moments the boy said
sample-016994,i recovered myself and continued the walk home
sample-016995,they rode for the entire day
sample-016996,then we can climb mt helen
sample-016997,he remembered what the old man had said about offering something you didn't even have yet
sample-016998,calibration complete
sample-016999,even then he hardly understood what this meant
sample-017000,i've already had that experience with my sheep and now it's happening with people
sample-017001,for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
sample-017002,he started to read the book he had bought
sample-017003,but i'm going to egypt the boy said
sample-017004,we were all made by the same hand and we have the same soul
sample-017005,on the very first page it described a burial ceremony
sample-017006,we have also started contemplating the possibility of moving back to colorado
sample-017007,i had seen all that it would presently bring me
sample-017010,and to do that you need money
sample-017011,the shower curtain is beige and white
sample-017012,drawing from my own experience as a learner of english and german i value engaging activities that involve everyday conversation
sample-017013,it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-017014,but the boy couldn't even speak
sample-017015,i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
sample-017016,they can't use the jena doug clubs for politics
sample-017017,scattered groups of people were hurrying from the direction of woking
sample-017028,it seemed such a little thing so bright and small and still
sample-017029,help me the boy said
sample-017038,there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
sample-017039,when you play cards the first time you are almost sure to win
sample-017040,to my satisfaction i have been mentioned in the credits for my proficiency
sample-017041,too many concessions have been made
sample-017042,they set off running wildly into the trees
sample-017044,now i'm beginning what i could have started ten years ago
sample-017045,they went to the kitchen at the back of the monastery
sample-017046,i know its dimensions and how it behaves
sample-017047,catalysts make chemical reactions possible at low temperatures
sample-017048,it seemed so safe and tranquil
sample-017049,i've crossed these sands many times said one of the camel drivers one night
sample-017050,his hands were abraded and exhausted but he listened to his heart
sample-017051,they reminded him of the old man
sample-017052,in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
sample-017053,there were really i think two or three hundred people elbowing one another
sample-017054,it brought his heart into his mouth
sample-017055,it was starlight and i explained the signs of the zodiac to her
sample-017056,the guy thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to stop him
sample-017058,the englishman prodded him and the boy asked her about the man who cured people's illnesses
sample-017059,but if you can try to make your own decisions
sample-017060,maybe no one here knows what an alchemist is
sample-017061,they shouted consolation and promises and went off back to the town again to get help
sample-017062,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
sample-017063,it was the first time she had done that
sample-017064,but the boy sat down and waited

sample-017247,the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
sample-017248,they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house

sample-017588,i'm going to them
sample-017589,i had never heard of alchemists before the boy said
sample-017598,you killed all three of them for nothing
sample-017599,and then there were the others who were interested only in gold
sample-017600,suddenly a huge quantity of green smoke came out of the pit in three puffs and went straight into the still air
sample-017601,he had studied latin spanish and theology
sample-017602,next morning there were two thousand armed men scattered throughout the palm trees at al fayoum
sample-017603,he paid for the wool and asked the shepherd to come back the following year
sample-017604,a young arab also loaded down with baggage entered and greeted the englishman
sample-017605,he was thinking about omens and someone had appeared
sample-017606,but now the sounds inside had stopped
sample-017607,you shouldn't be here the alchemist answered
sample-017610,it reminded him of the wool from his sheep
sample-017611,and you can quote me on that
sample-017612,i don't blame you
sample-017613,i just don't trust anyone who says they've never had hamburger helper
sample-017614,don't worry i took a cab to get home safely
sample-017615,because he knew what he would find
sample-017616,at that point the omens will tell you that your treasure is buried forever
sample-017617,we fold the organic ginger juice in with the candied ginger pulp
sample-017628,it was the first time she had done that
sample-017629,and tomorrow his enemy would also be a part of that soul
sample-017638,but before i go i want to tell you a little story
sample-017639,the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
sample-017640,the next day he gave his son a pouch that held three ancient spanish gold coins
sample-017641,coming home a party of tourists passed us singing and playing music
sample-017642,it seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of here
sample-017643,the newspaper articles had prepared everyone for the reception of the idea
sample-017644,when i had my sheep i was happy and i made those around me happy
sample-017645,i'd like to build a display case for the crystal the boy said to the merchant
sample-017646,we've been laughing all day about that
sample-017647,i will cast a dangerous spell
sample-017648,he took his money from his pouch and showed it to the young man
sample-017649,they're not concerned with that right now
sample-017650,have you seen sheriff pink
sample-017651,he felt weighted down by the centuries of time since the pyramids had been built
sample-017652,it's the other foreigner the englishman
sample-017653,it's called the principle of favorability
sample-017654,i don't know if i'll be able to find life in the desert the boy thought
sample-017655,you can't believe it's not butter
sample-017656,he should respect tradition
sample-017657,if he ever decided to leave them they would suffer
sample-017658,they'll find me anyhow
sample-017659,the boy accustomed to recognizing omens spoke to the merchant
sample-017660,he told them all to be seated
sample-017661,from then on the boy understood his heart
sample-017662,there was a thud like the fall of a great mass
sample-017663,but finally the merchant appeared and asked the boy to shear four sheep
sample-017664,the authorities in bordeaux have searched his compartment on the train
sample-017665,i want to talk to both of you
sample-017666,sit down and let me treat you to something said the boy
sample-017667,suddenly the elder at the center smiled almost imperceptibly and the boy felt better
sample-017668,this was my destiny not yours the alchemist answered
sample-017669,they stood there looking at the moon
sample-017670,he thought of the woman who had trusted in the desert
sample-017671,they were fascinating stories each of them lived out his destiny to the end
sample-017672,the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
sample-017673,as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
sample-017674,but fatima's hands held to the handles of her jug
sample-017675,maybe no one here knows what an alchemist is
sample-017676,i'm not going to charge you anything now she said
sample-017677,she must have known alex pretty well
sample-017678,you ain't gonna get me to stay here
sample-017679,his name was joseph
sample-017680,their faces were covered with the blue cloths and their eyes showed fear
sample-017681,sometimes it's not the right thing to do the right thing
sample-017682,have a good time
sample-017683,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
sample-017684,the boy took out urim and thummim from his bag
sample-017685,i was just in town earlier this year so it is kind of crazy to think about what took place right after
sample-017686,there are deformed fish in that lake
sample-017687,an huge hole had been made by the impact of the projectile
sample-017688,but that was simply because my eye was tired
sample-017689,you have helped me the man continued to prepare his tea saying nothing
sample-017690,where do you live shouted the boy as the horseman rode away
sample-017691,the boy told him then that he needed to get to the pyramids
sample-017692,he was sure the girl would never understand
sample-017693,that's the way it will be with our love for each other
sample-017694,and all's fair in love and war
sample-017695,he was shaken into wakefulness by someone
sample-017696,you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
sample-017697,a boy came running towards me
sample-017698,i dare her to move that desk out of here
sample-017699,all things are one the old man had said
sample-017700,the drivers carried the freight themselves over such treacherous footing and then reloaded the camels
sample-017701,a boy came running towards me
sample-017702,the wind began to pick up
sample-017703,there is only one way to learn the alchemist answered
sample-017704,he was bisexual i think
sample-017705,the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
sample-017706,the boy leapt as well but away from the alchemist
sample-017707,love required them to stay with the people they loved
sample-017708,it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
sample-017709,i didn't do anything
sample-017710,i know that girl
sample-017711,what're you trying to do
sample-017712,i found the compression phase problematic
sample-017713,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
sample-017714,tomorrow at this same time bring me a tenth of your flock
sample-017715,he paid for the wool and asked the shepherd to come back the following year
sample-017716,even then he hardly understood what this meant
sample-017717,then came a war
sample-017718,rest well tonight as if you were a warrior preparing for combat
sample-017720,his way isn't the same as mine nor mine as his
sample-017721,i'll return just as your father came back to your mother he said
sample-017722,then you'll die in the midst of trying to realize your destiny
sample-017723,ten years at the university and here i am in a corral
sample-017724,finally after hours of waiting the guard bade the boy enter
sample-017726,i need ten dollars
sample-017727,but that's what you're doing
sample-017728,among these people were a couple of cyclists a gardener i employed sometimes and a girl carrying a baby
sample-017729,then came the night of the first falling star
sample-017730,i'm trying to explain to my mother how to get pictures off her phone
sample-017732,he told me i should try to do so
sample-017733,in one he had read that many years ago a famous arabian alchemist had visited europe
sample-017734,but he kept quiet because he had heard what the alchemist said to the monk
sample-017735,there is a way out
sample-017736,imagine if everyone went around transforming lead into gold
sample-017737,the xylophone would just be a glockenspiel if it wasn't so metal
sample-017738,the burning fire had been extinguished
sample-017739,they were looking only for gold his companion answered
sample-017748,his name was joseph
sample-017749,they climbed a tall crane without securing themselves and filmed it for their youtube channel
sample-017758,i'll be back the boy said
sample-017759,he was immensely excited at the news
sample-017760,be careful with your prognostications said the stranger
sample-017761,the boy began again to read his book but he was no longer able to concentrate
sample-017762,they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
sample-017763,we went rafting in switzerland and alpine skiing in austria this spring
sample-017764,then the two went off to have some more tea
sample-017765,i'm a desert woman and i'm proud of that
sample-017766,when you play cards the first time you are almost sure to win
sample-017767,sometimes there's just no way to hold back the river
sample-017770,the top of the cylinder was rotating on its body
sample-017771,the desert was all sand in some stretches and rocky in others
sample-017772,but use them to buy your flock
sample-017773,the ceiling collapsed inwards
sample-017774,why the shots stopped after the tenth no one on earth has tried to explain
sample-017775,your money saved us for three days
sample-017776,there is a counter on the top left of the web page
sample-017777,well what good would it be to you if you had t die the alchemist answered
sample-017788,don't be an idiot
sample-017789,sometime during the second year you'll remember about the treasure
sample-017798,the boy reached the small abandoned church just as night was falling
sample-017799,i just wanted to be sure
sample-017808,can i help you asked the man behind the window
sample-017809,no the alchemist answered
sample-017818,when the sun sets the men will once again surrender their arms to me
sample-017819,did you see the garden that it took the master gardener ten years to create
sample-017820,i've had a dozen calls already
sample-017821,one that will write
sample-017822,no more tickets left
sample-017823,i didn't tell anybody
sample-017824,i've had a dozen calls already
sample-017825,light up with the street with johnson
sample-017826,now what do you say
sample-017827,the stranger placed his sword in its scabbard and the boy relaxed
sample-017830,he prepared himself a sandwich and drank some hot tea from a crystal glass
sample-017831,he used to lift kettlebells now he breathes fire
sample-017832,let's stop this another commander said
sample-017833,be sure you spell the name right
sample-017834,tux is not smiling he just looks nice all the time
sample-017835,dusk was falling as the boy arrived with his herd at an abandoned church
sample-017836,whenever he could he sought out a new road to travel
sample-017837,they were relieved and happy
sample-017840,a new movie is shown the first time in cinema
sample-017841,it was up there
sample-017842,wait a minute
sample-017843,it's the emerald tablet said the englishman proud that he might teach something to the boy
sample-017844,can bring me some muffins
sample-017845,there was a murmur from the crowd
sample-017846,maybe we'd better ask someone the boy suggested
sample-017847,the boy recalled the brilliance he had noticed on the previous day
sample-017848,and i told harry i thought i'd be bored to death
sample-017849,on the second day the boy climbed to the top of a cliff near the camp
sample-017850,there was a moment of silence so profound that it seemed the city was asleep
sample-017851,the horseman was completely immobile as was the boy
sample-017852,the conversation was interrupted by the warehouse boss
sample-017853,some went away while i was there and other people came
sample-017854,it's better that way
sample-017855,a kick in the butt is a step forward
sample-017856,the angel touched the man's shoulder and they were both projected far into the future
sample-017857,it sounded like a gypsy prayer
sample-017858,and one or two persons were returning
sample-017859,don't say anything fatima interrupted
sample-017860,the jacket had a purpose and so did the boy
sample-017861,it created a sensation
sample-017862,they were looking only for gold his companion answered
sample-017863,they went to the kitchen at the back of the monastery
sample-017864,heads popping back behind doors
sample-017865,it's for annabelle
sample-017866,you fight it cut
sample-017867,the streamer of gas came out towards us
sample-017868,nobody's trying to steal from you
sample-017869,it was glaringly hot not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind
sample-017870,the falcon's beak carries bits of me myself the desert said
sample-017871,if you pay attention to the present you can improve upon it
sample-017872,but he decided to take a chance
sample-017873,maybe the water was too hot
sample-017874,the war continued and at times the wind carried the sweet sickly smell of blood
sample-017875,so we their hearts speak more and more softly
sample-017876,you have all the papers there
sample-017877,the pat anthony party
sample-017878,i have to separate out the sulfur
sample-017879,that's a good luck omen the englishman said after the fat arab had gone out
sample-017880,the wind approached the boy and touched his face
sample-017881,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
sample-017882,you've resented me from the first moment you saw me
sample-017883,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
sample-017884,i said good night
sample-017885,in a couple of minutes
sample-017886,everyone seemed very excited
sample-017887,the space was spartan almost bare
sample-017888,maybe that's why they give up on it so early too
sample-017889,we need to solve this problem fast
sample-017890,i've got nobody else to leave it to
sample-017891,a lantern lit up the trees
sample-017892,i want to live again
sample-017893,dense clouds of smoke or dust can be seen through a powerful telescope
sample-017894,he waited patiently for the merchant to awaken and open the shop
sample-017895,and the alchemist understood that the boy's heart had returned to the soul of the world
sample-017896,how long is what
sample-017897,i have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk which was embedded in the ground
sample-017898,this is for you
sample-017899,hundreds must have seen it and taken it for a falling star
sample-017900,i'm looking for a treasure said the boy and he immediately regretted having said it
sample-017901,revenge is not my style but obviously accidents will happen
sample-017902,i told him that was what i had come here to learn
sample-017903,now you are talking about beer
sample-017904,at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars
sample-017905,at the same time people were passing my shop all the time heading for mecca
sample-017906,i'm hunting with my falcon the alchemist answered
sample-017907,did you want to see her about something important
sample-017908,the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
sample-017909,a part of me is also trying to come to terms with the fact that i won't be able to travel as much anymore
sample-017910,i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit
sample-017911,then suddenly he noticed it with a start
sample-017912,but i didnt think that it contained any living creature
sample-017913,at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars
sample-017914,my review of the sun one star
sample-017915,the monk laughed when he saw me come back in tatters
sample-017917,his soul must be too primitive to understand those things he thought
sample-017918,other servants maintained the fires in the hookahs
sample-017919,how did you learn to read the girl asked at one point
sample-017920,even if you cleaned my crystal for an entire year
sample-017921,most meteorites are more or less rounded
sample-017922,melchizedek watched a small ship that was plowing its way out of the port
sample-017923,i've watched you grow up from a little boy
sample-017924,the boy didn't know what a person's destiny was
sample-017925,it seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of here
sample-017926,the city was still sleeping
sample-017927,the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
sample-017928,sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
sample-017929,the alchemist told the boy to place the shell over his ear
sample-017930,everything has been written by the same hand
sample-017931,i'll kill both of them
sample-017932,get me a pitcher's glove
sample-017933,maktub thought the boy
sample-017934,how did peter lovelace get that gun
sample-017935,he knew nothing about the customs of the strange land he was in
sample-017936,you don't have to be rich skinny popular or even own a cape to perform a random act of kindness
sample-017937,meanwhile the boy thought about his treasure
sample-017938,my wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red green and yellow signal lights
sample-017939,no that's not what i mean
sample-017940,it's a man who understands nature and the world
sample-017941,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
sample-017942,something happens here you'll have to remember later on
sample-017943,if you start your emails with greetings let me be the first to welcome you to earth
sample-017944,many people in berkshire surrey and middlesex must have seen it
sample-017945,i felt like being in paradise
sample-017946,the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
sample-017947,three armed tribesmen approached and asked what the boy and the alchemist were doing there
sample-017950,it was there that the wise man lived
sample-017951,i didn't even ask him
sample-017952,and what do you do in salem he insisted
sample-017953,in any case the desert was impassable
sample-017954,you'd better get your friends
sample-017955,they were on the right track
sample-017956,something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top
sample-017957,for occupying the wrong parking lot he had to pay a fine
sample-017968,my mind ran on the possibilities of its content
sample-017969,coming home a party of tourists passed us singing and playing music
sample-017978,i'll see you get it in fifteen minutes
sample-017979,i just saw the sheriff
sample-017980,night after night holly came back late from the office
sample-017981,hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after
sample-017982,he sat looking at the sky for a long time
sample-017983,the alchemist followed as the boy's horse ran for almost half an hour
sample-017984,the boy was startled
sample-017985,then stop acting like one
sample-017986,can i get a woot woot
sample-017987,the boy knew a lot of people in the city
sample-017990,christopher was confused
sample-017991,don't give us that ethics stuff
sample-017992,i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit
sample-017993,i'd like to have my robe
sample-017994,i would bury it in the garden
sample-017995,some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound
sample-017996,and if you improve on the present what comes later will also be better
sample-017997,he was bisexual i think
sample-018000,we lit the lantern and walked over to his house
sample-018001,the boy stepped closer to the girl and when she smiled he did the same
sample-018002,why are you carrying money asked the tribesman when he had searched the boy's bag
sample-018003,the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
sample-018004,an army is coming the boy said
sample-018005,only in that way would he be able to read the omens
sample-018006,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
sample-018007,the end of the cylinder was still as ogilvy and henderson had left it
sample-018008,a line of flame high can be seen in the atmosphere
sample-018009,she likes you
sample-018010,look on the third shelf back of the eye wash
sample-018011,toward the end of the afternoon they came upon a coptic monastery
sample-018012,and a little charge of kidnapping i'm looking into
sample-018013,he drew on the back of his jacket with a blue fountain pen
sample-018014,the sheep had taught him that
sample-018015,did you get him
sample-018016,this desert was once a sea he said
sample-018017,something terrible's happened to me
sample-018018,but he didn't stop
sample-018019,i'm not gonna talk about them
sample-018020,there was very little talking
sample-018021,as soon as he saw me among the crowd he called to me to come down
sample-018022,the bench was long and strong
sample-018023,alfayoum is in egypt said the arab
sample-018024,he stood irresolute for a moment and then scrambled out of the pit
sample-018025,then taking his sheep he walked away
sample-018026,i'm not interested in your book
sample-018027,can i get a woot woot
sample-018028,before this i always looked to the desert with longing said fatima
sample-018029,well he thought about that the old man said
sample-018030,then like a colony of worker ants they dismantled their stalls and left
sample-018031,the boy watched the exchange with fascination
sample-018032,i asked him to let me use the kitchen for a while the alchemist smiled
sample-018033,it was the most delicious wine he had ever tasted
sample-018034,it's a good thing i got here in time
sample-018035,he arose and taking up his crook began to awaken the sheep that still slept
sample-018036,as soon as he saw me among the crowd he called to me to come down
sample-018037,well then help me do that the boy said
sample-018038,he could always become a crystal salesman again
sample-018039,the crowd swayed a little as i elbowed my way through
sample-018040,he had surprised himself with the thought
sample-018041,well interpret the dream he said
sample-018042,at once he connected the two incidents
sample-018043,there the alchemist separated the disk into four parts
sample-018044,you know where they are
sample-018045,i'll return just as your father came back to your mother he said
sample-018046,drawing from my own experience as a learner of english and german i value engaging activities that involve everyday conversation
sample-018047,because my eyes are not yet accustomed to the desert the boy said
sample-018050,and this is for me said the alchemist keeping one of the parts
sample-018051,and i hope mark beats higgins
sample-018052,men have never understood the words of the wise
sample-018053,that's a good idea
sample-018054,i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
sample-018055,the merchants were assembling their stalls and the boy helped a candy seller to do his
sample-018056,the river babbled inanely to itself
sample-018057,this morning i found a calculator taped to my wii
sample-018068,we therefore oppose the resolution
sample-018069,i want my baby to look like you
sample-018078,the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
sample-018079,that sobered him a little
sample-018080,many telescopes were pointed at it
sample-018081,it was aligned perfectly
sample-018082,you can only spit out so many seeds
sample-018083,i'm gonna get my arm fixed out of this
sample-018084,they'll believe him
sample-018085,i left my father my mother and the town castle behind
sample-018086,i'm not good enough to make this one up
sample-018087,the first day passed
sample-018090,when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
sample-018091,they were strange books
sample-018092,the war is going to end someday the girl said
sample-018093,the top had certainly ceased to rotate
sample-018094,the structure chattered throughout the earthquake
sample-018095,he approached the mass and was surprised at the size and the shape
sample-018096,you mean the one who drank so much
sample-018097,as the sun rose the men began to beat the boy
sample-018108,might start to rain again
sample-018109,the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
sample-018118,you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
sample-018119,sun is better than rain
sample-018120,which one is mine
sample-018121,isn't a word of truth in it
sample-018122,fatima is a woman of the desert said the alchemist
sample-018123,he noticed the unequal cooling of its surface
sample-018124,it must have fallen while i was sitting over there
sample-018125,as he was attempting to pull out the rocks he encountered he heard footsteps
sample-018126,for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
sample-018127,the ghost laughed in the weirdest way
sample-018130,an old man with a breastplate of gold wouldn't have lied just to acquire six sheep
sample-018131,relaxed and unhurried he resolved that he would walk through the narrow streets of tangier
sample-018132,so we their hearts speak more and more softly
sample-018133,our deadline is coming up rapidly and we will need help
sample-018134,it's too bad that he's quickly going to forget my name he thought
sample-018135,they reached the center of a large plaza where the market was held
sample-018136,we have also started contemplating the possibility of moving back to colorado
sample-018137,he almost began to tell about his treasure but decided not to do so
sample-018140,that's the principle that governs all things he said
sample-018141,how do you suppose ken got that gun
sample-018142,suddenly he disappeared and i could hear a faint shriek behind the walls
sample-018143,have you got a ring
sample-018144,i thought about whether we should find coins and models in it and so on
sample-018145,i never noticed how tall norwegian people are
sample-018146,i had seen all that it would presently bring me
sample-018147,they stood there looking at the moon
sample-018148,you wanna take this outside
sample-018149,advancing slowly they searched among the stones
sample-018150,he forgets the office when he's with me
sample-018151,love required them to stay with the people they loved
sample-018152,having heard that the boy became even more interested in alchemy
sample-018153,some went away while i was there and other people came
sample-018154,it's a man who understands nature and the world
sample-018155,what are you afraid of melissa
sample-018156,they were looking only for gold his companion answered
sample-018157,he got up early with the idea of finding it
sample-018158,when can i see him
sample-018159,at his side was the young arab the boy had spoken with earlier
sample-018160,that night there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet
sample-018161,during the third year the omens will continue to speak of your treasure and your destiny
sample-018162,absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
sample-018163,remember remember the fifth of november
sample-018164,maybe tomorrow said the boy moving away
sample-018165,not unless we're blind
sample-018166,he wants me to write down only things that i think about but not things i plan to do
sample-018167,charles darwin became famous for his evolutionary theory
sample-018168,the alchemist was a bit daunting but as the boy drank the wine he relaxed
sample-018169,the englishman could not contain his excitement
sample-018170,let's call him up
sample-018171,you should show that your method improves results
sample-018172,and also by unhappiness envy and jealousy
sample-018173,they called it the simum and it was worse than a storm at sea
sample-018174,they were fascinating stories each of them lived out his destiny to the end
sample-018175,it was just that he couldn't grasp what it meant
sample-018176,the war continued and at times the wind carried the sweet sickly smell of blood
sample-018177,but if you have to go before then go on in pursuit of your dream
sample-018178,that sobered him a little
sample-018179,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
sample-018180,because i've always heard about them the boy answered saying nothing about his dream
sample-018181,the nurse waddled around the ward
sample-018182,he was betting on that outcome
sample-018183,in that case i'll ask the two executive officers to withdraw
sample-018184,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
sample-018185,i dont mind working from home most of the time but i do miss having coworkers
sample-018186,the heather was on fire and you could see a thin blue smoke rising up slowly
sample-018187,the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees
sample-018188,an hour later he had before him a chest of spanish gold coins
sample-018189,except for the dream
sample-018190,and at that i told him and he took my place
sample-018191,i want to talk to you
sample-018192,it's on the level
sample-018193,but that was simply because my eye was tired
sample-018194,we lit the lantern and walked over to his house
sample-018195,i was just in town earlier this year so it is kind of crazy to think about what took place right after
sample-018196,she wants to be alone
sample-018197,are you coming tomorrow
sample-018198,but would you mind telling me who goes out
sample-018199,the end of the cylinder was still as ogilvy and henderson had left it
sample-018200,got to get some practice
sample-018201,absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
sample-018202,at the first glance it was really not very exciting
sample-018203,the morning post is not obstructing justice or hiding criminals
sample-018204,you brought a new feeling into my crystal shop
sample-018205,when i had my sheep i was happy and i made those around me happy
sample-018206,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
sample-018207,amira congratulations on graduating summa cum laude
sample-018208,but there was a sixth day the sun went on
sample-018209,there was a shimmering green light emanating from the statue
sample-018210,most of them were staring quietly at the big table
sample-018211,there was no empathy for her now
sample-018212,we run smack into a police patrol
sample-018213,this was the strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space
sample-018214,and in that mood he was grateful to be in love
sample-018215,then the two went off to have some more tea
sample-018216,is your husband with you
sample-018217,the level ground was blackened as far as one could see and it was still giving off smoke
sample-018218,but he certainly didn't desire that an army invade the oasis
sample-018219,you must always know what it is that you want the old king had said
sample-018220,one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
sample-018221,it reminded him of the wool from his sheep
sample-018222,that's the magic of omens said the boy
sample-018223,why don't you have your friends join us
sample-018224,the microphone put out a muffled signal
sample-018225,all i saw was an army said the boy
sample-018226,he took the fourth part and handed it to the monk
sample-018227,he knew what i was thinking the boy said to himself
sample-018228,what is love the desert asked
sample-018229,everything on earth is being continuously transformed because the earth is alive
sample-018230,the emerald tablet is a direct passage to the soul of the world
sample-018231,the city was still sleeping
sample-018232,the day was hot and the wine was refreshing
sample-018233,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
sample-018234,he had assumed he would soon return to his sheep
sample-018235,why not right here
sample-018236,ogilvy watched till one and then gave up
sample-018237,what had been next to him five minutes ago was now at the other side
sample-018238,the alchemist told the boy to place the shell over his ear
sample-018239,to show you one of life's simple lessons the alchemist answered
sample-018240,and look how many things the wind already knew how to do
sample-018241,the three fell silent
sample-018242,like everybody learns he said
sample-018243,the tribe was almost eradicated
sample-018244,take your paws off me
sample-018245,the jacket had a purpose and so did the boy
sample-018246,there are no words to describe how difficult that day was
sample-018247,that gives you an idea of what i'm up against
sample-018250,i've got to talk to you straight from the shoulder
sample-018251,but bakers are more important people than shepherds
sample-018252,most meteorites are more or less rounded
sample-018253,it brought his heart into his mouth
sample-018254,there was a moment of silence so profound that it seemed the city was asleep
sample-018255,it's not so bad
sample-018256,it was faintly marked with transverse stripes and slightly flattened from the perfect round
sample-018257,most of them were staring quietly at the big table
sample-018268,you can't go in there until you put this on
sample-018269,if a person is living out his destiny he knows everything he needs to know
sample-018278,there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
sample-018279,what was spoken was totally disregarded
sample-018280,the only tribesman spared was the commander of the battalion
sample-018281,on the seventh day the alchemist decided to make camp earlier than usual
sample-018282,he had found where his treasure was and was frightened at what might happen
sample-018283,something smells around here
sample-018284,the man was speaking the language of alchemy
sample-018285,but the marketplace was empty and he was far from home so he wept
sample-018286,ronnie watched in horror as the mirror transformed
sample-018287,he was thinking about omens and someone had appeared
sample-018290,an huge hole had been made by the impact of the projectile
sample-018291,i don't want anything else in life
sample-018292,but everyone and his aunt lilian's been through that bag
sample-018293,but now the sounds inside had stopped
sample-018294,who engineered this getaway
sample-018295,we've got to walk up to the tower
sample-018296,the greatest authority on meteorites stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles
sample-018297,if that guy lays an egg
sample-018308,it was my fear of failure that first kept me from attempting the master work
sample-018309,it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-018318,and there were dunes rocks and plants that insisted on living where survival seemed impossible
sample-018319,watch out for his venom the boy said
sample-018320,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
sample-018321,i want to see him do it said the chief
sample-018322,and he vanished around the corner of the plaza
sample-018323,a line of flame high can be seen in the atmosphere
sample-018324,the sheep will get used to my not being there too the boy thought
sample-018325,he listened to the wind and felt the stones beneath his feet
sample-018326,no more tickets left
sample-018327,don't say those things
sample-018330,people continued to come and go from the baker's shop
sample-018331,and he knew what was the fair price for every one of his animals
sample-018332,everyone on earth has a treasure that awaits him his heart said
sample-018333,they're just a pile of stones
sample-018334,calibration complete
sample-018335,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
sample-018336,i don't like people to do that because the sheep are afraid of strangers
sample-018337,you've been doing mighty good work lately
sample-018340,we need to talk
sample-018341,is daddy in trouble
sample-018342,well usually i learn more from my sheep than from books he answered
sample-018343,they made the boy continue digging but he found nothing
sample-018344,i went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the dark
sample-018345,all this happened between sunrise and sunset the boy thought
sample-018346,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
sample-018347,she carefully removed the evidence from its packaging
sample-018348,your appointment has been changed
sample-018349,he stood irresolute for a moment and then scrambled out of the pit
sample-018350,most meteorites are more or less rounded
sample-018351,but they don't count
sample-018352,toronto is a few miles away
sample-018353,the sword didn't fall
sample-018354,please don't appeal to my sentimental side
sample-018355,how can i ever face him
sample-018356,i can see april coming
sample-018357,the tribal chieftain called for the boy and presented him with fifty pieces of gold
sample-018359,salmon is one of the most popular fish and very delicious though usually not sustainable
sample-018360,he needed someone to talk to so as to avoid thinking about the possibility of war
sample-018361,the packaging was broken
sample-018362,i have had the same dream twice he said
sample-018363,their faces were hidden behind blue veils with only their eyes showing
sample-018365,what are they doing the old man asked pointing at the people in the plaza
sample-018366,i'd like to have my robe
sample-018367,it's usually customary to bring the money with you
sample-018368,if it were he would already have heard of it
sample-018369,the boy put the stones in his pouch
sample-018371,i have already found my treasure
sample-018372,the top had certainly ceased to rotate
sample-018373,it's not i the wind spoke about
sample-018374,i locked eyes with a fish in the tank
sample-018375,just thirty short days
sample-018376,at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars
sample-018377,fatima is a woman of the desert said the alchemist
sample-018378,you wanna take this outside
sample-018379,there is a dentist and some other doctors inside this clinic
sample-018380,the quicker the better
sample-018381,her father's awful worried about her
sample-018382,my agreement with you gentlemen stands
sample-018383,they set off running wildly into the trees
sample-018384,but we've all got to get in there and play
sample-018385,you couldn't even be honest about being dishonest
sample-018386,the packaging was broken
sample-018387,i had to test your courage the stranger said
sample-018388,where your treasure is there also will be your heart the alchemist had told him
sample-018389,that he wanted to travel
sample-018390,he had surprised himself with the thought
sample-018391,because i don't live in either my past or my future
sample-018392,you can't do that to me
sample-018393,they have cheap sausages and fries at the brewery tomorrow
sample-018394,why a revolver he asked
sample-018395,i don't know how to turn them into reality
sample-018396,he was immensely excited at the news
sample-018397,i guess you must think i'm kinda batty
sample-018398,only the lights in the great tent remained
sample-018399,the secret is here in the present
sample-018400,the caravan moved toward the east
sample-018401,he dressed in his arabian clothing of white linen bought especially for this day
sample-018403,he prepared himself a sandwich and drank some hot tea from a crystal glass
sample-018404,i don't know how to turn them into reality
sample-018405,there was very little talking
sample-018406,it was starlight and i explained the signs of the zodiac to her
sample-018407,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
sample-018408,the top of the cylinder was rotating on its body
sample-018409,henderson stood up with a spade in his hand
sample-018410,i've actually fallen in love with him
sample-018411,sure i know where she lives
sample-018412,which one are you
sample-018413,it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
sample-018414,coming home a party of tourists passed us singing and playing music
sample-018415,we're in no hurry the chief answered
sample-018417,two more months passed and the shelf brought many customers into the crystal shop
sample-018418,the funny thing about the horizon is that you can't reach it
sample-018419,they wanted to save the oasis
sample-018420,the boy told him then that he needed to get to the pyramids
sample-018421,that night there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet
sample-018422,because the crystal was dirty
sample-018423,you will never be able to escape from your heart
sample-018424,how do you know what they're doing
sample-018425,air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
sample-018426,mecca is a lot farther away than the pyramids
sample-018427,he knew how to shear them and how to slaughter them
sample-018428,he recited an our father silently
sample-018429,the downside of this approach is that you will have to remember to pause between commands of these two different classes
sample-018430,there were really i think two or three hundred people elbowing one another
sample-018431,the jacket had a purpose and so did the boy
sample-018432,i have to find a man who knows that universal language
sample-018433,the insurgents gathered sticks and wood
sample-018434,it's extremely suspicious that there's no information about brains that didn't come from a brain
sample-018435,get me my check book
sample-018436,the boy reminded the old man that he had said something about hidden treasure
sample-018437,something happens here you'll have to remember later on
sample-018438,i've got a mother and two kid sisters to care for
sample-018439,did you tell them that funny story you told me yesterday
sample-018440,that brings you good luck for ten years
sample-018441,the boy awoke as the sun rose
sample-018442,i have no information about troops or about the movement of the tribes
sample-018443,i'm not hiding anything the boy answered
sample-018444,there's a caravan leaving today for alfayoum
sample-018445,i'm sorry it's impossible
sample-018446,they went to the kitchen at the back of the monastery
sample-018447,once again he was experiencing the language without words
sample-018450,it's extremely suspicious that there's no information about brains that didn't come from a brain
sample-018451,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
sample-018452,that was his work
sample-018453,but i didnt think that it contained any living creature
sample-018454,the boy thought it a strange question
sample-018455,that night there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet
sample-018456,the tribal chieftain called for the boy and presented him with fifty pieces of gold
sample-018457,but none of that mattered to the alchemist
sample-018468,and to do that you need money
sample-018469,even me  i haven't thought of other women since i met the merchant's daughter
sample-018478,i don't know the desert that well yet
sample-018479,because now he knew where his treasure was
sample-018480,don't say those things
sample-018481,they tell their incredible stories at the time when you want to hear them
sample-018482,he was immensely excited at the news
sample-018483,if good things are coming they will be a pleasant surprise said the seer
sample-018484,all that time the martians must have been getting ready
sample-018485,in nuremberg the subway trains are driving autonomously
sample-018486,how do i feel
sample-018487,he took out one of the stones
sample-018490,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
sample-018491,why the shots stopped after the tenth no one on earth has tried to explain
sample-018492,looking through the telescope i saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet
sample-018493,it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-018494,their horses cried out and all their weapons were filled with sand
sample-018495,your method is systematic and mostly reasonably motivated
sample-018496,it's extremely suspicious that there's no information about brains that didn't come from a brain
sample-018497,before him was an enormous white horse rearing over him with a frightening scream
sample-018508,the twelve dollars includes everything
sample-018509,they blow across the world without a birthplace and with no place to die
sample-018518,the boy felt a pang in his heart thinking about the merchant's daughter
sample-018519,but when the reign of tiberius ended his poems were forgotten
sample-018520,now i will drift gently off to dreamland
sample-018521,but my heart is agitated the boy said
sample-018522,do you know him
sample-018523,then she took both of his hands in hers and began quietly to pray
sample-018524,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
sample-018525,you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
sample-018526,it would have been visible to me had i only looked up as it passed
sample-018527,no that's not what i mean
sample-018530,then what does she want with you
sample-018531,then taking his sheep he walked away
sample-018532,among these people were a couple of cyclists a gardener i employed sometimes and a girl carrying a baby
sample-018533,how am i going to live until the bank opens
sample-018534,now give us sixty days on this
sample-018535,you can't offer me something that is already mine the chief said arrogantly
sample-018536,is there anything wrong
sample-018537,most algorithms are not very sensitive to the type of normalization used
sample-018540,dennis was not a business man
sample-018541,it means only that the heart does what it can the alchemist said
sample-018542,the stranger was speaking of things that very few people knew about
sample-018543,the boy was shaking with fear but the alchemist helped him out of the tent
sample-018544,he thought about asking him to give it back but decided that would be unfriendly
sample-018545,mary told me that she got to meet up with you while she was back in san francisco
sample-018546,so we their hearts speak more and more softly
sample-018547,get martin out of jail
sample-018548,they both spoke the same language
sample-018549,i don't think he was any faker not with that face
sample-018550,use the factory pattern and an iterator to step through the array
sample-018551,i heard a faint movement under my feet
sample-018552,i was impatient to see it opened
sample-018553,curse the moment i met that old man he thought
sample-018554,somewhere you are holding the person i love the boy said
sample-018555,the vision vanished immediately but it had shaken him
sample-018556,when he's an old man he's going to spend a month in africa
sample-018557,he saw the boy appear from the other side of the dunes
sample-018558,the crowd swayed a little as i elbowed my way through
sample-018559,i went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the dark
sample-018560,tell me more about your dream said the woman
sample-018561,shoot through the desk
sample-018562,you've only had five meals today
sample-018563,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
sample-018564,let's call him up
sample-018565,now give us sixty days on this
sample-018566,the other son was a poet and delighted all of rome with his beautiful verses
sample-018567,i have been waiting for her to respond for two days now so i just went ahead and did it for her
sample-018568,i'm going to school
sample-018569,when you are loved you can do anything in creation
sample-018570,but she said nothing
sample-018571,nobody's trying to steal from you
sample-018572,he was immensely excited at the news
sample-018573,only the lights in the great tent remained
sample-018574,finally a young woman approached who was not dressed in black
sample-018575,work for somebody else
sample-018576,some of the grey ash was falling off the circular edge
sample-018577,but he takes advantage of you
sample-018578,nope not going unless they have a giant inflatable slide
sample-018579,he picked up the two stones and put them back in his pouch
sample-018580,a little college girl from a school of journalism
sample-018581,you haven't seen anything yet
sample-018582,he was proud of himself
sample-018583,he doesn't have anything else
sample-018584,that's not true the boy said
sample-018585,robin had some sort of date with tracy
sample-018586,what's going on in there
sample-018587,the caravans had been stopped at giza for some time waiting for the wars to end
sample-018588,there was very little talking
sample-018589,i have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk which was embedded in the ground
sample-018590,and maybe it wasn't that they were teaching me but that i was learning from them
sample-018591,i want you to help me turn myself into the wind the boy answered
sample-018592,always ask an objective question
sample-018593,give zero of  stars to the current album
sample-018594,he felt weighted down by the centuries of time since the pyramids had been built
sample-018595,strange images passed through my mind
sample-018596,so what do you want of me the sun asked
sample-018597,that's an intrinsic error
sample-018598,there was no way for everybody to know about alchemy
sample-018599,nearby was the englishman reading a book
sample-018600,we lit the lantern and walked over to his house
sample-018601,the sheep had taught him that
sample-018602,it would have been visible to me had i only looked up as it passed
sample-018603,remember remember the fifth of november
sample-018604,there's life here the boy said to the alchemist
sample-018605,they reached the center of a large plaza where the market was held
sample-018606,when i returned to the common the sun was setting
sample-018607,it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
sample-018608,did she ever go exploring
sample-018609,then suddenly he noticed it with a start
sample-018610,it was difficult not to think about what he had left behind
sample-018611,and continue to pay heed to the omens
sample-018612,but the boy was too frightened to listen to words of wisdom
sample-018613,we've got to walk up to the tower
sample-018614,everything in life is an omen said the englishman now closing the journal he was reading
sample-018615,that's the philosopher's stone and the elixir of life
sample-018616,i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
sample-018617,it was the pure language of the world
sample-018618,the boy looked out at the horizon
sample-018619,you have developed a serious case of pneumonia
sample-018620,the boy awoke as the sun rose
sample-018621,every image processing software contains automatic contrast and color enhancement
sample-018622,it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
sample-018623,who do you feel is responsible for that
sample-018624,a large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered
sample-018625,i used to look at those women and envy them their happiness
sample-018626,we know that and we are used to it
sample-018627,but finally he agreed that the boy who spoke better arabic than he should do so
sample-018628,you can have as many babies as you like
sample-018629,the boy tried to read what was written in the sand
sample-018630,all that time the martians must have been getting ready
sample-018631,that's big of you
sample-018632,a shepherd may like to travel but he should never forget about his sheep
sample-018633,i'm just a fool
sample-018634,then i don't get paid
sample-018635,the two men hurried back and found the cylinder still lying in the same position
sample-018636,listen don't believe what he says
sample-018637,sorry but i'm allergic to that
sample-018638,the newspaper articles had prepared everyone for the reception of the idea
sample-018639,i felt like bruce wayne building his batcave
sample-018640,i'm proud of it
sample-018641,throughout the entire day we will be on the lookout for our enemies
sample-018642,he drew on the back of his jacket with a blue fountain pen
sample-018643,the levanter was still getting stronger and he felt its force on his face
sample-018644,it was my fear of failure that first kept me from attempting the master work
sample-018645,he didn't want his hand to begin trembling showing the old woman that he was fearful
sample-018646,you old sorcerer the boy shouted up to the sky
sample-018647,the other son was a poet and delighted all of rome with his beautiful verses
sample-018650,who told you that asked the boy startled
sample-018651,but most important he was able every day to live out his dream
sample-018652,we've got the biggest story in the world
sample-018653,the serpent relaxed immediately
sample-018654,if you start your emails with greetings let me be the first to welcome you to earth
sample-018655,earlier this year we found a really nice place near my office and we moved in together
sample-018656,but i didnt think that it contained any living creature
sample-018657,i wished i had a light to smoke by
sample-018668,he wanted to say so to the alchemist but he was afraid of the man
sample-018669,this isn't for me to decide
sample-018678,he didn't want his hand to begin trembling showing the old woman that he was fearful
sample-018679,what do i do in salem the old man laughed
sample-018680,whenever he saw the sea or a fire he fell silent impressed by their elemental force
sample-018681,what a wonderful weather
sample-018682,but i felt miserable watching him wither away like a shriveled dandelion
sample-018683,what's she saying now
sample-018684,who do you think writes them
sample-018685,i don't care what you say
sample-018686,at the camp it was difficult to see anything
sample-018687,heehaw and merry christmas
sample-018690,the crowd swayed a little as i elbowed my way through
sample-018691,it's done in america all the time
sample-018692,in another year maybe i can help
sample-018693,he moved about invisible but everyone could hear him
sample-018694,the boy looked out at the horizon
sample-018695,your government is counting on you
sample-018696,don't be a fool
sample-018697,the monk laughed when he saw me come back in tatters
sample-018708,as was mecca for the merchant
sample-018709,and one or two persons were returning
sample-018718,they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
sample-018719,as secretary you can hire anyone you like
sample-018720,somewhere you are holding the person i love the boy said
sample-018721,and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
sample-018722,she says she's gonna write fiction
sample-018723,the alchemist's words echoed out like a curse
sample-018724,you have a mania for simplifying everything answered the englishman irritated
sample-018725,hold your nose to keep the smell from disabling your motor functions
sample-018726,i'm just a man who wanders the desert and knows the stars said the alchemist
sample-018727,we've done it said the englishman who had also awakened early
sample-018730,you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
sample-018731,i went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the dark
sample-018732,the englishman's eyes lit up
sample-018733,you should see the other guy specifically how good at fighting he is
sample-018734,neighbors moved away and there remained only a few small shops on the hill
sample-018735,team  will meet up at point b with team 
sample-018736,he must know how to deal with the snakes of the desert
sample-018737,as soon as he saw me among the crowd he called to me to come down
sample-018740,he stood irresolute for a moment and then scrambled out of the pit
sample-018741,as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
sample-018742,no that's not what i mean
sample-018743,so his heart was quiet for an entire afternoon
sample-018744,the boy repeated his question
sample-018745,i have been waiting for you here at this oasis for a long time
sample-018746,my wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red green and yellow signal lights
sample-018747,that florescent pink colour is hurting my eyes
sample-018748,don't wait till the game is called on account of darkness
sample-018749,people say strange things the boy thought
sample-018750,what do you want to know
sample-018751,they mounted their horses and rode out in the direction of the pyramids of egypt
sample-018752,love required them to stay with the people they loved
sample-018753,and so despite the fact that he was a roman centurion he converted to their faith
sample-018754,when i had my sheep i was happy and i made those around me happy
sample-018755,i think we were wrong about sally having the money
sample-018756,it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
sample-018757,but everything that happens twice will surely happen a third time
sample-018758,one of the world's biggest problems is the growth of human population
sample-018759,when he reached the top of the dune his heart leapt
sample-018760,a line of flame high can be seen in the atmosphere
sample-018761,from atop its walls one can catch a glimpse of africa
sample-018762,then suddenly they kneel and die
sample-018763,i really hope i can earn a badge for finishing the class
sample-018764,he should have decided to become a shepherd the boy said
sample-018765,the old man looked disappointed
sample-018766,and finally the falcon returned with their meal
sample-018767,he decided to concentrate on more practical matters
sample-018768,starting with his own
sample-018769,the englishman's eyes lit up
sample-018770,this isn't a kidnapping
sample-018771,if you want something you gotta go get it
sample-018772,'m all about those invisible cosmic connections that transcend time and distance
sample-018773,he's watching the other door
sample-018774,i've already had that experience with my sheep and now it's happening with people
sample-018775,hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after
sample-018776,that's the reason why i came in fourth
sample-018777,the heat lasted until nightfall and all that time he had to carry his jacket
sample-018778,it could have been written much more clearly
sample-018779,i found these one day in the fields
sample-018780,it seemed so safe and tranquil
sample-018781,so how will we name all these hurricanes
sample-018782,you've got the mayor and pullman backed against a wall
sample-018783,on the third day the chief met with his officers
sample-018784,many telescopes were pointed at it
sample-018785,but i found it difficult to get to work because of the investigations
sample-018786,you must not let up even after having come so far he continued
sample-018787,she would never know the difference because she didn't know how to read
sample-018788,even then he hardly understood what this meant
sample-018789,afraid it might rain
sample-018790,but arms cannot be drawn unless they also go into battle
sample-018791,that's the way it will be with our love for each other
sample-018792,i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
sample-018793,the boy was shocked
sample-018794,i think they're going to last for a long time he said to the monk
sample-018795,the letter's our only clue
sample-018796,we've got to do something
sample-018797,the reason for this is to discern your strengths
sample-018798,i need you to be spontaneous he asked me out to din din
sample-018799,what do you want here today the desert asked him
sample-018800,i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
sample-018801,they're not worth much the englishman answered
sample-018802,emoticons are familiar to everyone nowadays
sample-018803,i pointed out mars a bright dot of light
sample-018804,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
sample-018805,i have a confession to make
sample-018806,the boy became fearful the omens told him that something was wrong
sample-018807,if you start your emails with greetings let me be the first to welcome you to earth
sample-018808,he took back his books and packed them away again in their bags
sample-018809,and because the tribes declared war i went to the well seeking the alchemist
sample-018810,maybe that's why they give up on it so early too
sample-018811,yeah its definitely worth checking out especially if the pay is reasonable and the work is good for your career
sample-018812,even if you cleaned my crystal for an entire year
sample-018813,the boy knew the desert sensed his fear
sample-018814,the building and what
sample-018815,they formed heaps that are visible a mile and a half away
sample-018816,she never grew up
sample-018817,he noticed the unequal cooling of its surface
sample-018818,he decided to stay right there and await his return
sample-018819,the snake fought frantically making hissing sounds that shattered the silence of the desert
sample-018820,when the pan had cooled the monk and the boy looked at it dazzled
sample-018821,artificial neural networks can do something very similar
sample-018822,those women are all card sharks don't be fooled
sample-018823,for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
sample-018824,and i will tell you how to find the hidden treasure
sample-018825,i burned the omelette
sample-018826,from that day on the oasis would be an empty place for her
sample-018827,the sun was very hot this summer
sample-018828,that was his work
sample-018829,i learned the alchemist's secrets in my travels
sample-018830,i don't know how to find life in the desert the boy said
sample-018831,he got up early with the idea of finding it
sample-018832,his name was joseph
sample-018833,but that's what you're doing
sample-018834,hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after
sample-018835,a large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered
sample-018836,will you get out and let me handle this
sample-018837,before long maybe in just a few days he would be at the pyramids
sample-018838,he sat looking at the sky for a long time
sample-018839,you ain't gonna get me to stay here
sample-018848,and you've told me nothing along the way said the boy
sample-018849,i'll have it in a minute
sample-018858,aren't you going to tell me
sample-018859,go back to watching the caravan he said
sample-018860,even if you cleaned my crystal for an entire year
sample-018861,they don't see that the fields are new and the seasons change
sample-018862,the guy thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to stop him
sample-018863,the boy knew the desert sensed his fear
sample-018864,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
sample-018865,they were fascinating stories each of them lived out his destiny to the end
sample-018866,tell nathan to get on the extension
sample-018867,but you know that i'm not going to go to mecca
sample-018870,for every ten dead men among our enemies you will receive a piece of gold
sample-018871,when the pan had cooled the monk and the boy looked at it dazzled
sample-018872,i don't know why you boys are so good to me
sample-018873,it seemed as if what the old king had called beginner's luck were no longer functioning
sample-018874,you'll watch them as they grow demonstrating how the world is always changing
sample-018875,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
sample-018876,this man's going to jump off a roof
sample-018877,but now the sounds inside had stopped
sample-018888,looking at the sun he calculated that he would reach tarifa before midday
sample-018889,if i don't find it i can always go home
sample-018898,he dabbled in painting drawing and photography before finding his true passion
sample-018899,you have told me about your dreams about the old king and your treasure
sample-018900,the englishman said nothing
sample-018901,should i understand the emerald tablet the boy asked
sample-018902,i changed my mind
sample-018903,the text is often unnecessarily obscure
sample-018904,give me precise instructions how to decontaminate the trooper
sample-018905,the article addresses image classification with local image descriptors
sample-018906,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
sample-018907,at the highest point in tarifa there is an old fort built by the moors
sample-018910,why the shots stopped after the tenth no one on earth has tried to explain
sample-018911,and there were dunes rocks and plants that insisted on living where survival seemed impossible
sample-018912,the cinema was abandoned
sample-018913,alchemy is a serious discipline
sample-018914,it was the old man who spoke first
sample-018915,he just got a new kite for his birthday
sample-018916,i had seen all that it would presently bring me
sample-018917,it seemed so safe and tranquil
sample-018928,how often do you want to eat
sample-018929,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
sample-018938,the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
sample-018939,he was so ashamed that he wanted to cry
sample-018940,this was my destiny not yours the alchemist answered
sample-018941,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
sample-018942,it was glaringly hot not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind
sample-018943,zombies were parading in the streets and drinking beer from paper cups
sample-018944,his speech ended in standing ovations
sample-018945,you seem to think i've never done this before
sample-018946,the heather was on fire and you could see a thin blue smoke rising up slowly
sample-018947,he called to the boy and they took a walk along the dunes surrounding the encampment
sample-018948,the railway station was locked up by the police
sample-018949,the closer he got to the realization of his dream the more difficult things became
sample-018950,there's the professor now
sample-018951,but he didn't need to worry about that right now
sample-018952,and you've told me about omens
sample-018953,the boy approached her to ask about the alchemist
sample-018954,what do you mean it's okay
sample-018955,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
sample-018956,i'm sending it over with beth
sample-018957,she gave them each a half to make them work together
sample-018958,is that job still open
sample-018959,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
sample-018960,i don't like people to do that because the sheep are afraid of strangers
sample-018961,what happened to your wings
sample-018962,the boy turned to the hand that wrote all
sample-018963,where the sand was more substantial
sample-018964,he stood irresolute for a moment and then scrambled out of the pit
sample-018965,i heard a faint movement under my feet
sample-018966,revenge is not my style but obviously accidents will happen
sample-018967,will you give me your blessing asked the boy
sample-018968,in those days very few of the people had any idea about astronomy
sample-018969,i'll give you three minutes to tell me where she is
sample-018970,he wanted your money he said
sample-018971,there were raised voicesand some sort of struggle appeared to be going on 
sample-018972,it seemed so safe and tranquil
sample-018973,but don't worry the alchemist continued
sample-018974,henderson was taking it in
sample-018975,the arab accepted them without a word
sample-018976,wish i had a million dollars
sample-018977,what are you doing here
sample-018978,i wonder whether we will be able to harvest energy from fusion reactors
sample-018979,and he told what he had seen
sample-018980,the shop is exactly the size i always wanted it to be
sample-018981,a genuine loving cup
sample-018982,he doesn't have anything else
sample-018983,the three fell silent
sample-018984,i ain't seen him for a week
sample-018985,should i understand the emerald tablet the boy asked
sample-018986,calibration complete
sample-018987,in alchemy it's called the soul of the world
sample-018988,yet it was a little too large for assurance
sample-018989,what's the matter
sample-018990,the sun burned mercilessly from the sky
sample-018991,i have no information about troops or about the movement of the tribes
sample-018992,you have no children
sample-018993,so how will we name all these hurricanes
sample-018994,many telescopes were pointed at it
sample-018995,joel is a good guy
sample-018996,the meeting was over
sample-018997,they jetted off to the bahamas
sample-018998,whenever he saw the sea or a fire he fell silent impressed by their elemental force
sample-018999,i need you to be spontaneous he asked me out to din din
sample-019000,not only did he manage to do it he did it professionally
sample-019001,you certainly delivered the goods
sample-019002,and the alchemist understood that the boy's heart had returned to the soul of the world
sample-019003,it was the devil
sample-019004,there were just drawings coded instructions and obscure texts
sample-019005,suddenly he disappeared and i could hear a faint shriek behind the walls
sample-019006,he got up early with the idea of finding it
sample-019007,the bootloader shows a dialog prompting to enter the passphrase
sample-019010,we're an extension of the wartime marines
sample-019011,they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
sample-019012,just thirty short days
sample-019013,but i'm beginning to understand a lot of things
sample-019014,it has happened many times before
sample-019015,a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder
sample-019016,looking at the sun he calculated that he would reach tarifa before midday
sample-019017,something terrible's happened to me
sample-019028,i'll return just as your father came back to your mother he said
sample-019029,if i don't find it i can always go home
sample-019038,it is i who dared to do so said the boy
sample-019039,he seemed unfriendly and had looked irritated when the boy had entered
sample-019040,the medical industry saves lives
sample-019041,at his side was the young arab the boy had spoken with earlier
sample-019042,are you enjoying london
sample-019043,it sounded like a gypsy prayer
sample-019044,this was a lie and they all knew it
sample-019045,i never saw amanda act like that before
sample-019047,the newspaper articles had prepared everyone for the reception of the idea
sample-019048,the shop is exactly the size i always wanted it to be
sample-019049,they're going to believe that one
sample-019050,accidents in nuclear power plants are potentially catastrophic
sample-019051,there were raised voicesand some sort of struggle appeared to be going on 
sample-019053,the desert fills men's hearts with visions the camel driver answered
sample-019054,he hoped that it would be someone as capable as his previous apprentice
sample-019055,the one you're blocking
sample-019056,they have their eyes glued on his face
sample-019057,it's a nasty day
sample-019058,your dentist called yesterday
sample-019059,all things are one the old man had said
sample-019060,i'm afraid i might have soiled the couch a little with my shoes eddie murphy
sample-019061,well i'd like to see their land and see how they live said his son
sample-019062,it sounded like a gypsy prayer
sample-019063,many telescopes were pointed at it
sample-019064,don't try to enter into the life of the oasis
sample-019065,that's the philosopher's stone and the elixir of life
sample-019066,the newspaper articles had prepared everyone for the reception of the idea
sample-019067,he was immensely excited at the news
sample-019068,you are almost at the end of your journey said the alchemist
sample-019069,there was a murmur from the crowd
sample-019070,but don't worry the alchemist continued
sample-019071,i'm going to them
sample-019072,the top had certainly ceased to rotate
sample-019073,you are wise because you observe everything from a distance the boy said
sample-019074,but he appeared to be unaware of any danger
sample-019075,i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
sample-019076,and he wasn't faring much better
sample-019077,maybe no one here knows what an alchemist is
sample-019078,none of what the old man was saying made much sense to the boy
sample-019079,i can't deal with this any more
sample-019080,first they tried to find him on their own
sample-019081,how to avoid a massive dieoff of the colony
sample-019082,you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
sample-019083,he was going to miss the place and all the good things he had learned
sample-019084,there were really i think two or three hundred people elbowing one another
sample-019086,i locked eyes with a fish in the tank
sample-019087,it made a faint whistling sound
sample-019088,so he began to wander through the city and found himself at the gates
sample-019089,that sobered him a little
sample-019090,i can't please everybody
sample-019092,wait for the signal
sample-019093,it was the pure language of the world
sample-019094,'under construction' is simply translated to 'super fun playground'
sample-019095,tangier is not like the rest of africa
sample-019096,this morning i found a calculator taped to my wii
sample-019097,looking down at the spoon he held the boy saw that the oil was gone
sample-019098,when the pan had cooled the monk and the boy looked at it dazzled
sample-019099,revenge is not my style but obviously accidents will happen
sample-019100,he had seen the shooting star and was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere nearby
sample-019101,her hair flowed down her back
sample-019102,sometimes i appear in the form of a solution or a good idea
sample-019103,right back at you
sample-019104,these trousers don't fit very well
sample-019105,listen to that mob
sample-019106,he was shaken into wakefulness by someone
sample-019107,absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
sample-019108,before the boy could reply a butterfly appeared and fluttered between him and the old man
sample-019109,i don't want to rush you
sample-019110,i retrieved the crop with a pallet jack
sample-019111,the tradition teaches men how to cross the desert and how their children should marry
sample-019112,it seemed such a little thing so bright and small and still
sample-019113,once to the thief and once to the general
sample-019114,is this the ear you can't hear on
sample-019115,four hundred and fifty dollars
sample-019116,something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top
sample-019117,they play duets together
sample-019118,next morning there were two thousand armed men scattered throughout the palm trees at al fayoum
sample-019119,i'm not afraid of failing
sample-019120,the boy continued to listen to his heart as they crossed the desert
sample-019121,i never even noticed she had one
sample-019122,then came the night of the first falling star
sample-019123,he wanted to tell him about fatima
sample-019124,it didn't even occur to the boy to flee
sample-019125,coming home a party of tourists passed us singing and playing music
sample-019126,so you can kill me too
sample-019127,but they were not there
sample-019128,the boy was shocked
sample-019129,they were suffering from hunger
sample-019130,that night there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet
sample-019131,yeah its definitely worth checking out especially if the pay is reasonable and the work is good for your career
sample-019132,it was more activity than usual for this time of the morning
sample-019133,she seems very indifferent almost apathetic
sample-019134,and in that mood he was grateful to be in love
sample-019135,maybe we can wait a little bit before changing the titles and the text everywhere else
sample-019136,is it all right
sample-019137,this morning i found a calculator taped to my wii
sample-019138,you been in a fight
sample-019139,milkshake is best in its chocolate form
sample-019148,the crowd swayed a little as i elbowed my way through
sample-019149,that party was amazing
sample-019158,then a man approached
sample-019159,the caravans had been stopped at giza for some time waiting for the wars to end
sample-019160,you didn't have to do any cleaning he said
sample-019161,instead the stranger lowered it slowly until the point touched the boy's forehead
sample-019162,when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
sample-019163,i don't want any maybe
sample-019164,much better said the old man
sample-019165,they were strange books
sample-019166,they shouted consolation and promises and went off back to the town again to get help
sample-019167,joel is a good guy
sample-019170,he remembered the sword
sample-019171,there must be a language that doesn't depend on words the boy thought
sample-019172,but they were not there
sample-019173,they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
sample-019174,people talk a lot about omens thought the shepherd
sample-019175,so he asked if the old man's blessing was still with him
sample-019176,many telescopes were pointed at it
sample-019177,give me my book the boy said
sample-019188,i thought you were going to teach me some of the things you know
sample-019189,at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
sample-019198,he's watching the other door
sample-019199,so what should i do now the boy asked
sample-019200,most meteorites are more or less rounded
sample-019201,you lived your life in a loving way and died with dignity
sample-019202,and now it was only four days before he would be back in that same village
sample-019203,and you've told me about omens
sample-019204,get some water quickly
sample-019205,there were raised voicesand some sort of struggle appeared to be going on 
sample-019206,where are you from the boy asked
sample-019207,proteins have many functions in the human body
sample-019210,who told you that asked the boy startled
sample-019211,and i'm certain you'll find it the alchemist said
sample-019212,when were these books written the boy asked
sample-019213,he took the fourth part and handed it to the monk
sample-019214,you're here rather early
sample-019215,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
sample-019216,i'm afraid she'd feel ashamed to think she hadn't trusted you
sample-019217,he's not a failure
sample-019228,you're far too valuable
sample-019229,you go on and practice
sample-019238,the people were also praying to heaven for protection
sample-019239,from then on he would make his own decisions
sample-019240,the internet is built upon many protocols which compliment each other perfectly
sample-019241,so he asked if the old man's blessing was still with him
sample-019242,the twelve dollars includes everything
sample-019243,come on in here now
sample-019244,the newspaper articles had prepared everyone for the reception of the idea
sample-019245,where do you live shouted the boy as the horseman rode away
sample-019246,the two walked out among the palms
sample-019247,some people make the same mistakes over and over again
sample-019248,everyone seemed very excited
sample-019249,the englishman had been profoundly impressed by the story
sample-019250,it's extremely suspicious that there's no information about brains that didn't come from a brain
sample-019251,what do you know about that
sample-019252,and he knew what was the fair price for every one of his animals
sample-019253,we're all excited around here
sample-019254,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
sample-019255,the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
sample-019256,the boy reached the small abandoned church just as night was falling
sample-019257,any minute now we could be assassinated
sample-019258,but he found it much more interesting to observe the caravan and listen to the wind
sample-019259,upon returning to the wise man he related in detail everything he had seen
sample-019260,a friend of yours
sample-019261,never advertise razors by shaving a monkey it's cruel and results in lawsuits
sample-019262,what do you know about that
sample-019263,as they sat down at the only table in the place the crystal merchant laughed
sample-019264,tickets for the broadcast are all gone
sample-019265,just a memory right now it signified shade water and a refuge from the war
sample-019266,absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
sample-019267,the heather was on fire and you could see a thin blue smoke rising up slowly
sample-019268,it helped me to trust in people the englishman answered
sample-019269,i finally have enough money and all the time i need
sample-019270,the hand with the whip pointed to the south
sample-019271,most of them were staring quietly at the big table
sample-019272,we'll stay right here and celebrate
sample-019273,when she saw the unknown object bobbing up and down the edge she was absolutely horrified
sample-019274,you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
sample-019275,let's have a look at the standard deviation
sample-019276,but i found it difficult to get to work because of the investigations
sample-019277,he had to spit some tobacco out of his mouth
sample-019278,a boy came running towards me
sample-019279,but he had to move on
sample-019280,a large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered
sample-019281,what's the idea of locking this
sample-019282,do you know someone here who cures people's illnesses the boy asked
sample-019283,the nearby city of ceuta had grown faster than tangier and business had fallen off
sample-019284,they were relieved and happy
sample-019285,you can do this
sample-019286,we need to be confident all of us he proposed a solution
sample-019287,but they were not there
sample-019288,dennis couldn't approach the monolith
sample-019289,they ate in silence
sample-019290,the chain rule is applied twice to this formula
sample-019291,he appeared with the first stars of evening
sample-019292,they tell their incredible stories at the time when you want to hear them
sample-019293,he felt uneasy at the man's presence
sample-019294,do you want to go to work for me the merchant asked
sample-019295,he paused for a moment to see if the woman knew what the egyptian pyramids were
sample-019296,i used to live near el cairum he said
sample-019297,it said that the darkest hour of the night came just before the dawn
sample-019298,his name was joseph
sample-019299,scattered groups of people were hurrying from the direction of woking
sample-019300,life is complicated
sample-019301,the horseman was completely immobile as was the boy
sample-019302,there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
sample-019303,he condemned the commander to death without honor
sample-019304,wearing his new sandals he descended the stairs silently
sample-019305,i wouldn't take that too seriously
sample-019306,it means only that the heart does what it can the alchemist said
sample-019307,but just before lunchtime a boy stopped in front of the shop
sample-019308,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
sample-019309,i don't want to change anything because i don't know how to deal with change
sample-019310,i had seen all that it would presently bring me
sample-019311,he condemned the commander to death without honor
sample-019312,after all what he had always wanted was just that to know new places
sample-019313,i was scared but wasted no time in going out and crossing the bridge to the sand pits
sample-019314,two days ago you said that i had never dreamed of travel the merchant answered
sample-019315,they were surrounded by children curious to look at the animals and people that were arriving
sample-019316,mark untaped the package carefully
sample-019317,she asked herself how many times do i need to listen to him sing
sample-019318,only the lights in the great tent remained
sample-019319,scattered groups of people were hurrying from the direction of woking
sample-019320,if we serve tea in crystal the shop is going to expand
sample-019321,there was a murmur from the crowd
sample-019322,you have a mania for simplifying everything answered the englishman irritated
sample-019323,you are wise because you observe everything from a distance the boy said
sample-019324,he sat looking at the sky for a long time
sample-019325,the guy thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to stop him
sample-019326,to nourish the falcon
sample-019327,i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
sample-019328,the whole creature heaved and pulsated convulsively
sample-019329,it seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of here
sample-019330,it was starlight and i explained the signs of the zodiac to her
sample-019331,he walked slowly through the market
sample-019332,dusk was falling as the boy arrived with his herd at an abandoned church
sample-019333,there the alchemist separated the disk into four parts
sample-019334,the horse reared again raising a cloud of dust
sample-019335,she put on her slippers scaled the stairs and went to bed
sample-019336,about eleven i walked back to my home in maybury because nothing seemed to be happening
sample-019337,he had suddenly remembered that in tarifa there was an old woman who interpreted dreams
sample-019338,you don't deny that
sample-019339,henderson was taking it in
sample-019348,i'm the king of salem the old man had said
sample-019349,the idea frightened him
sample-019358,the old man returned the book to the boy
sample-019359,one afternoon one of his servants fell ill and it appeared that he would die
sample-019360,the boy took them to the cliff where he had been on the previous day
sample-019361,without responding the guard entered the tent where he remained for some time
sample-019362,he quickly pulled his hands away
sample-019363,scattered groups of people were hurrying from the direction of woking
sample-019364,they were looking only for gold his companion answered
sample-019365,death doesn't change anything the boy thought
sample-019366,watch out for his venom the boy said
sample-019367,the old man gave a signal and everyone stood
sample-019370,who you holding out on
sample-019371,let's get out of here said the new arrival
sample-019372,i suppose all this is leading somewhere
sample-019373,did you say a king he asked
sample-019374,don't let anybody in or out
sample-019375,what does she look like
sample-019376,he was immensely excited at the news
sample-019377,and he gave the boy his blessing
sample-019388,like eating or sleeping or like seeking love or finding a job
sample-019389,over here in the bushes
sample-019398,i could die happily and that made me feel good
sample-019399,it's the master work of the alchemists
sample-019400,why don't you try johns hopkins in baltimore
sample-019401,one of these days is tomorrow
sample-019402,i should say not
sample-019403,the englishman could not contain his excitement
sample-019404,we've done it said the englishman who had also awakened early
sample-019405,at night they spread their sleeping gear and kept their fires hidden
sample-019406,something just flew by
sample-019407,i understand sheep they're no longer a problem and they can be good friends
sample-019410,well i'd like to see their land and see how they live said his son
sample-019411,why didn't i call you back
sample-019412,too bad i couldn't see this guy first
sample-019413,you left out number five
sample-019414,there are rumors of tribal wars he told them
sample-019415,it's not a battle of good against evil
sample-019416,all i saw was an army said the boy
sample-019417,can i get a woot woot
sample-019428,i'm sending it over with beth
sample-019429,you don't have to wait till january
sample-019438,it spread through the planet's atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features
sample-019439,what idiot wrote this total drivel
sample-019440,but he decided first to buy his bakery and put some money aside
sample-019441,that baker he said to himself without completing the thought
sample-019442,i know good crystal from bad and everything else there is to know about crystal
sample-019443,and she already has her treasure it's you
sample-019444,it means only that the heart does what it can the alchemist said
sample-019445,the boy took out urim and thummim from his bag
sample-019446,he reached over and picked up a shell from the ground
sample-019447,when i had my sheep i was happy and i made those around me happy
sample-019448,my tax dollars pay for those public school proms
sample-019449,i heard what you were talking about the other day with the alchemist the wind said
sample-019450,he didn't consider mending the hole  the stones could fall through any time they wanted
sample-019451,he had seen the shooting star and was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere nearby
sample-019452,he spent the entire morning observing the infrequent comings and goings in the street
sample-019453,i don't understand what you're talking about the desert said
sample-019454,i could eat a horse
sample-019455,i'd like to do that
sample-019456,the streamer of gas came out towards us
sample-019457,get the bulletin board
sample-019458,other servants maintained the fires in the hookahs
sample-019459,i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
sample-019460,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
sample-019461,they shouted consolation and promises and went off back to the town again to get help
sample-019462,about eleven i walked back to my home in maybury because nothing seemed to be happening
sample-019463,i came over with johnny
sample-019464,the vision vanished immediately but it had shaken him
sample-019465,hang on a second
sample-019466,i have to separate out the sulfur
sample-019467,i'm going to them
sample-019468,a lot of patience but shepherds know all about patience
sample-019469,he knelt down to find urim and thummim and put them back in the pouch
sample-019470,there is a reptile in my western shoes
sample-019471,the boy was strong and wanted to retaliate but he was in a foreign country
sample-019472,the desert didn't answer him for a few moments
sample-019473,at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars
sample-019474,what had been next to him five minutes ago was now at the other side
sample-019475,there were really i think two or three hundred people elbowing one another
sample-019476,as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
sample-019477,what's the matter with you
sample-019478,the wind told me that you know about love the boy said to the sun
sample-019479,the horseman was completely immobile as was the boy
sample-019480,he started to read the book he had bought
sample-019481,but if you can try to make your own decisions
sample-019482,just by looking at them
sample-019483,this isn't knitting its weaving
sample-019484,he knew nothing about the customs of the strange land he was in
sample-019485,i want to stay at the oasis the boy answered
sample-019486,the owner of the bar came over and looked as well
sample-019487,i thought about whether we should find coins and models in it and so on
sample-019488,how much does this cost
sample-019489,the boy climbed the dune slowly
sample-019490,i have the most beautiful voice you have ever heard
sample-019491,i know why i want to get back to my flock he thought
sample-019492,maybe this is an omen said the englishman half aloud
sample-019493,the president just decorated him
sample-019494,you been in a fight
sample-019495,i feel fine now
sample-019496,he came to understand its dodges and tricks and to accept it as it was
sample-019497,maktub the boy said remembering the crystal merchant
sample-019498,your son went to serve at a distant place and became a centurion
sample-019499,can i help you asked the man behind the window
sample-019500,he was older and was carrying a small bucket
sample-019501,maybe because that wasn't really his dream
sample-019502,just thirty short days
sample-019503,i often wish you weren't such a stinker
sample-019504,i have had the same dream twice he said
sample-019505,the pie is a lie
sample-019506,i don't care if you've been after it for six years
sample-019507,i was impatient to see it opened
sample-019508,he stood irresolute for a moment and then scrambled out of the pit
sample-019509,scientific work is hard
sample-019510,i thought about whether we should find coins and models in it and so on
sample-019511,because i've always heard about them the boy answered saying nothing about his dream
sample-019512,is it a deal
sample-019513,the old man was probably a gypsy too
sample-019514,i like cyndi wayne
sample-019515,for a moment everything was dark and scary
sample-019516,everywhere there were stalls with items for sale
sample-019517,i dreamt i was your father
sample-019518,i don't think i know that one
sample-019519,you are pronouncing it wrong
sample-019520,you're the only one in town that can help me
sample-019521,the old man wore a breastplate of gold and he knew about my past
sample-019522,even me  i haven't thought of other women since i met the merchant's daughter
sample-019523,among these people were a couple of cyclists a gardener i employed sometimes and a girl carrying a baby
sample-019524,can i help you asked the man behind the window
sample-019525,keep your shirt on
sample-019526,even me  i haven't thought of other women since i met the merchant's daughter
sample-019527,most of them were staring quietly at the big table
sample-019528,epilepsy is a condition which sends the sufferer into uncontrollable convulsions
sample-019529,you knew the whole story
sample-019530,and i will tell you how to find the hidden treasure
sample-019531,he walked slowly through the market
sample-019532,there's one that says 'everything that happens once can never happen again
sample-019533,how did you learn to read the girl asked at one point
sample-019534,and we had a bite
sample-019535,but there was something there in his heart that wouldn't allow him to do so
sample-019536,yes that's what love is
sample-019537,i never knew he had a diary
sample-019538,she has always been very kind and friendly to everyone even strangers
sample-019539,where do you live
sample-019548,as they began to decorate the hallway a silhouette appeared in the doorway
sample-019549,the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
sample-019558,where's ashley's wallet
sample-019559,and in that mood he was grateful to be in love
sample-019560,i don't know how to find life in the desert the boy said
sample-019561,i was wondering if you would work on this project with me because i cant find anyone else
sample-019562,it seemed so safe and tranquil
sample-019563,i never saw this thing before in my life
sample-019564,and he wasn't faring much better
sample-019565,one afternoon one of his servants fell ill and it appeared that he would die
sample-019566,an important difference is the amount of experiences that is to say inputs
sample-019567,i wanted to sleep a little longer he thought
sample-019570,she keeps saying that she has no regrets about moving back home but im not sure if its entirely true
sample-019571,the caravan moved toward the east
sample-019572,it's going to take a while the boy said
sample-019573,something bright reflected from his chest with such intensity that the boy was momentarily blinded
sample-019574,at once he connected the two incidents
sample-019575,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
sample-019576,night fell and an assortment of fighting men and merchants entered and exited the tent
sample-019577,but the boy was certain that he had been looking at them
sample-019588,he had already seen many people come and go and the desert remained as it was
sample-019589,and so despite the fact that he was a roman centurion he converted to their faith
sample-019598,when you are loved you can do anything in creation
sample-019599,sometimes there's just no way to hold back the river
sample-019600,and also by unhappiness envy and jealousy
sample-019601,john catherine topped them all
sample-019602,they both spoke the same language
sample-019603,and will we do things
sample-019604,it's past your bedtime
sample-019605,he recited an our father silently
sample-019606,whenever he could he sought out a new road to travel
sample-019607,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
sample-019610,from where i am the sun said i can see the soul of the world
sample-019611,denise hoovered the rug
sample-019612,another who was searching the boy's bags found the piece of gold
sample-019613,most meteorites are more or less rounded
sample-019614,it seemed so safe and tranquil
sample-019615,a line of flame high can be seen in the atmosphere
sample-019616,but they could never have taught him arabic
sample-019617,the boy was relieved
sample-019628,their horses cried out and all their weapons were filled with sand
sample-019629,at his side was the young arab the boy had spoken with earlier
sample-019638,the boy put the stones in his pouch
sample-019639,they become the soul o f the world
sample-019640,he transformed himself into a stone that rolled up to the miner's foot
sample-019641,and a labor leader like melville
sample-019642,the police probably think i killed him
sample-019643,then i take it there are no objections
sample-019644,it is up there
sample-019645,upon returning to the wise man he related in detail everything he had seen
sample-019646,this time i'm sure of it
sample-019647,yeah better if people are already familiar with one and are thinking of switching to the other
sample-019648,they provided warnings about thieves and barbarian tribes
sample-019649,he's out duckshooting now
sample-019650,he was sure the girl would never understand
sample-019651,when were these books written the boy asked
sample-019652,so now i'm a camel driver
sample-019653,and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
sample-019654,two horsemen waiting ahead of them
sample-019655,just by looking at them
sample-019656,i don't know why these things have to be transmitted by word of mouth he thought
sample-019657,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
sample-019658,i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
sample-019659,you lived your life in a loving way and died with dignity
sample-019660,it didn't bring with it the smell of the desert nor the threat of moorish invasion
sample-019661,you have told me about your dreams about the old king and your treasure
sample-019662,the octopus worried the squid
sample-019663,the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
sample-019664,but then they wouldn't be a part of your future the seer had said
sample-019665,the boy was relieved
sample-019666,mrs ruth victor wants to see you
sample-019667,but if you have to go before then go on in pursuit of your dream
sample-019668,the scabbard was embossed in silver and the handle was black and encrusted with precious stones
sample-019669,of course the two were unable to do anything
sample-019670,the briefing room was abandoned
sample-019671,ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
sample-019672,he paid for the wool and asked the shepherd to come back the following year
sample-019673,henderson was taking it in
sample-019674,hires two personal trainers and make one of them train the other one
sample-019675,and i'd better read your books said the boy
sample-019676,have you seen sheriff pink
sample-019677,the tradition teaches men how to cross the desert and how their children should marry
sample-019678,the navy's going to fly father home this afternoon
sample-019679,the land was ruined and i had to find some other way to earn a living
sample-019680,we'll just start by impounding the post property
sample-019681,but i found it difficult to get to work because of the investigations
sample-019682,the camel drivers exchanged information about windstorms and told stories about the desert
sample-019683,arabs often appeared in the city shopping and chanting their strange prayers several times a day
sample-019684,but none of that mattered to the alchemist
sample-019685,i'm so glad to see you
sample-019686,but that's why you created the game in the first place the boy answered
sample-019687,you were seen at the enemy camp three days ago
sample-019688,he was immensely excited at the news
sample-019689,my mind ran on the possibilities of its content
sample-019690,he carried two dead hawks over his shoulder
sample-019691,i had seen all that it would presently bring me
sample-019692,i make my living forecasting the future for people he said
sample-019693,the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
sample-019694,get martin out of jail
sample-019695,those are the rules of war the leader explained
sample-019696,we've got to find him
sample-019697,i would have won the junior olympics if not for those medaling kids
sample-019698,henderson stood up with a spade in his hand
sample-019699,would you show these gentlemen to the door
sample-019700,the greatest authority on meteorites stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles
sample-019701,he knew how to shear them and how to slaughter them
sample-019702,then he dropped his spade picked up his jacket and came out into the road
sample-019703,want to give my flower a drink
sample-019704,i'm leaving today said the boy
sample-019705,it seemed so safe and tranquil
sample-019706,i was impatient to see it opened
sample-019707,thank you for reading this out loud
sample-019709,where do you come from
sample-019710,i don't want anything for myself
sample-019711,the top of the cylinder was rotating on its body
sample-019712,most meteorites are more or less rounded
sample-019713,did you say a king he asked
sample-019714,the wind's curiosity was aroused something that had never happened before
sample-019715,there were raised voicesand some sort of struggle appeared to be going on 
sample-019716,the next day he gave his son a pouch that held three ancient spanish gold coins
sample-019717,fifty bucks ain't going to ruin me
sample-019718,your son went to serve at a distant place and became a centurion
sample-019719,kenneth reacted badly to the steroids he's under observation for the next hour
sample-019721,they formed heaps that are visible a mile and a half away
sample-019722,i imagine this will be a surprise to some people
sample-019723,and don't forget to make him wear his raincoat in london
sample-019724,the kyoto style coffee does not disappoint
sample-019725,i can help him
sample-019726,you can't be the wind the wind said
sample-019727,my friend bought all the other sheep immediately
sample-019728,so it's better to listen to what it has to say
sample-019729,i was scared but wasted no time in going out and crossing the bridge to the sand pits
sample-019730,she saved the lives of every man on that transport
sample-019731,someone set fire to the trash
sample-019732,so what do you want of me the sun asked
sample-019733,at the first glance it was really not very exciting
sample-019735,mayonnaise is made from eggs oil vinegar and mustard
sample-019736,he seemed unfriendly and had looked irritated when the boy had entered
sample-019737,the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
sample-019738,will you give me your blessing asked the boy
sample-019739,but bakers are more important people than shepherds
sample-019748,don't you want me to stay
sample-019749,then what does she want with you
sample-019758,i can work for the rest of today the boy answered
sample-019759,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
sample-019760,i have the diet of a kid who found twenty dollars
sample-019761,i was just in town earlier this year so it is kind of crazy to think about what took place right after
sample-019762,he was immensely excited at the news
sample-019763,did you hear what i said
sample-019764,it brought his heart into his mouth
sample-019765,improving the public transport system would help avoid traffic jams
sample-019766,as they moved along the boy tried to listen to his heart
sample-019767,and he gave the boy his blessing
sample-019770,the thief wasn't there and the owner brought him a cup of tea
sample-019771,he took out his money and counted it
sample-019772,tomorrow at this same time bring me a tenth of your flock
sample-019773,the boy was shocked
sample-019774,at once he connected the two incidents
sample-019775,he enjoyed the water in his cup
sample-019776,the boy knew and was now working toward it
sample-019777,don't you know me
sample-019788,the englishman didn't answer him directly
sample-019789,let me out of here
sample-019798,you wanna take this outside
sample-019799,it brought his heart into his mouth
sample-019808,do you see this
sample-019809,they crossed the desert for another two days in silence
sample-019818,when i returned to the common the sun was setting
sample-019819,his way isn't the same as mine nor mine as his
sample-019820,had our instruments permitted it we might have been able to see the trouble way back when
sample-019821,you wanna take this outside
sample-019822,toward the end of the afternoon they came upon a coptic monastery
sample-019823,why there's oceans of room here
sample-019824,gypsies are experts at getting people to do that sighed the old man
sample-019825,what's the matter with you
sample-019826,the alchemist followed as the boy's horse ran for almost half an hour
sample-019827,the boy's heart began to speak of fear
sample-019830,the top of the cylinder was rotating on its body
sample-019831,i thought about whether we should find coins and models in it and so on
sample-019832,better hurry and shave
sample-019833,the octopus worried the squid
sample-019834,the fire burned the fox
sample-019835,i'll just watch him he said to himself
sample-019836,harry hoped he would see some success from the current project
sample-019837,i thought about whether we should find coins and models in it and so on
sample-019840,i came to tell you just one thing the boy said
sample-019841,and the names of the people involved were very difficult to pronounce
sample-019842,he approached the mass and was surprised at the size and the shape
sample-019843,and he wasn't faring much better
sample-019844,his speech ended in standing ovations
sample-019845,i have the diet of a kid who found twenty dollars
sample-019846,younger man what he had seen and the man asked him to wait there
sample-019847,all that time the martians must have been getting ready
sample-019848,you can do a lot just using your voice but there are still a few times you'll find yourself reaching for a mouse
sample-019849,there the alchemist separated the disk into four parts
sample-019850,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
sample-019851,to accelerate progress towards this new world of endtoend open source handsfree coding
sample-019852,make you're a hero sure as you're born
sample-019853,the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
sample-019854,the last time she came in here
sample-019855,we went to the zoo to see the zebras
sample-019856,the cacophony reached a crescendo that almost tore our ear drums
sample-019857,the sheep will get used to my not being there too the boy thought
sample-019858,how much do you want
sample-019859,no hope no adventure no old kings or destinies no treasure and no pyramids
sample-019860,we don't know when the war will end so we can't continue our journey he said
sample-019861,a young arab also loaded down with baggage entered and greeted the englishman
sample-019862,so what is salem like he asked trying to get some sort of clue
sample-019863,thank god you're there
sample-019864,so that those who have the responsibility for understanding can understand he said
sample-019865,it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience
sample-019866,people saw me coming and welcomed me he thought
sample-019867,we couldn't make it in a week
sample-019868,the boy repeated his question
sample-019869,it was sprayed in red with yellow edges
sample-019870,don't try to move
sample-019871,he watched the hawks as they drifted on the wind
sample-019872,is there a mrs joshua
sample-019873,its important to keep an open mind and she has urged me to do the same
sample-019874,but men began to reject simple things and to write tracts interpretations and philosophical studies
sample-019875,they are so used to me that they know my schedule he muttered
sample-019876,some went away while i was there and other people came
sample-019877,the book that most interested the boy told the stories of the famous alchemists
sample-019878,we need somebody like you
sample-019879,this requires a little thought here
sample-019880,the diver forced open the oyster revealing a shimmering pearl
sample-019881,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
sample-019882,we lit the lantern and walked over to his house
sample-019883,but i was also stumbling because i couldnt look away from these things
sample-019884,but they could never have taught him arabic
sample-019885,just one thing more
sample-019886,i'm hunting with my falcon the alchemist answered
sample-019887,let me talk to him
sample-019888,the top had certainly ceased to rotate
sample-019889,i should say not
sample-019890,i told him that was what i had come here to learn
sample-019891,we want to see you
sample-019892,this wool jumper is itchy
sample-019893,the men climbed the hill and they were tired when they reached the top
sample-019894,it brought his heart into his mouth
sample-019895,all the joy he had seen that morning had suddenly disappeared
sample-019896,hey i bought pineapple juice with no sugar added
sample-019897,we can both hear
sample-019898,the greatest yarn ever written by anybody
sample-019899,the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
sample-019900,he sat on a stone and allowed himself to become hypnotized by the horizon
sample-019901,now i too will be one of the women who wait
sample-019902,you must understand that love never keeps a man from pursuing his destiny
sample-019903,better get a pencil out and write it down
sample-019904,it had told him to dig where his tears fell
sample-019905,in a way so am i he said
sample-019906,they're only made of rock crystal and there are millions of rock crystals in the earth
sample-019908,where are you from the boy asked
sample-019909,why would a king be talking with a shepherd the boy asked awed and embarrassed
sample-019910,i'm surprised the boy said
sample-019911,the boy noticed that the man's clothing was strange
sample-019912,he remembered what the old man had said about offering something you didn't even have yet
sample-019914,do you know what's wrong with you
sample-019915,some went away while i was there and other people came
sample-019916,one afternoon one of his servants fell ill and it appeared that he would die
sample-019917,c'mon over and join our party
sample-019918,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
sample-019919,you didn't have to do any cleaning he said
sample-019920,you don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you
sample-019921,younger man what he had seen and the man asked him to wait there
sample-019922,among these people were a couple of cyclists a gardener i employed sometimes and a girl carrying a baby
sample-019923,suddenly there is so much more time in a day because she no longer has to spend hours commuting
sample-019924,what's the world's greatest lie the boy asked completely surprised
sample-019925,the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
sample-019926,at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars
sample-019927,don't try and lick that pole your tongue will get stuck
sample-019928,i'm doing much better and soon you'll be able to return to your sheep
sample-019929,you can read all about it in the newspapers there
sample-019930,the sweet corn tasted better grilled
sample-019931,if you can concentrate always on the present you'll be a happy man
sample-019932,his way isn't the same as mine nor mine as his
sample-019933,and look how many things the wind already knew how to do
sample-019934,what's the matter with you boys
sample-019935,he noticed the unequal cooling of its surface
sample-019936,this kettle is quicker at boiling water than the old one
sample-019937,he had suddenly remembered that in tarifa there was an old woman who interpreted dreams
sample-019938,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
sample-019939,she must have known alex pretty well
sample-019940,and then there were the others who were interested only in gold
sample-019941,no he heard a voice on the wind say
sample-019942,of course the two were unable to do anything
sample-019943,when he had completed the cleaning he asked the man for something to eat
sample-019944,tell them all to wait
sample-019945,the alchemist opened a bottle and poured a red liquid into the boy's cup
sample-019946,i know how they feel
sample-019947,it seemed he had made the long journey for nothing
sample-019950,how much is your equity in it
sample-019951,ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
sample-019952,you are almost at the end of your journey said the alchemist
sample-019953,the boy took them to the cliff where he had been on the previous day
sample-019954,when he reached the top of the dune his heart leapt
sample-019955,his name was joseph
sample-019956,the caravan would be very lucky to reach the oasis
sample-019957,the company's stock value increased dramatically after they found a new medicine
sample-019968,he's right in my office there
sample-019969,boris the lion cried like a donkey
sample-019978,the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
sample-019979,the boy leapt as well but away from the alchemist
sample-019980,i'd like to have my robe
sample-019981,the only tribesman spared was the commander of the battalion
sample-019982,he called to the boy and they took a walk along the dunes surrounding the encampment
sample-019983,he dressed in his arabian clothing of white linen bought especially for this day
sample-019984,what did you do with her
sample-019985,i wanted them to be a part of your inheritance
sample-019986,he thought that with some patience he'd be able to transform everything into gold
sample-019987,the old man wore a breastplate of heavy gold covered with precious stones
sample-019990,then it became a signal of danger
sample-019991,why can't she get along with me
sample-019992,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
sample-019993,then i don't get paid
sample-019994,celebrations rang out across the land
sample-019995,most meteorites are more or less rounded
sample-019996,i'll be back the boy said
sample-019997,the alchemist dismounted slowly and the boy did the same
sample-020000,you won't miss anything
sample-020001,the boss sent me over with it
sample-020002,reading is not the same as understanding
sample-020003,if you dig this tunnel below the building it will collapse so i urge you to not do it
sample-020004,the burning fire had been extinguished
sample-020005,i'm not supposed to tell
sample-020006,there were raised voicesand some sort of struggle appeared to be going on 
sample-020007,you lived your life in a loving way and died with dignity
sample-020008,the thirteenth of march is meant to be unlucky
sample-020009,it seems old and wise
sample-020010,all the joy he had seen that morning had suddenly disappeared
sample-020011,then she filled her vessel with water and left
sample-020012,we know that and we are used to it
sample-020013,most meteorites are more or less rounded
sample-020014,at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
sample-020015,at night they spread their sleeping gear and kept their fires hidden
sample-020016,the boy said nothing
sample-020017,the war continued and at times the wind carried the sweet sickly smell of blood
sample-020018,i read only what the birds wanted to tell me
sample-020019,it was a litmus test
sample-020020,i have the diet of a kid who found twenty dollars
sample-020021,he remembered what the old man had said about offering something you didn't even have yet
sample-020022,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
sample-020023,at the first glance it was really not very exciting
sample-020024,if i could i'd write a huge encyclopedia just about the words luck and coincidence
sample-020025,just you and i
sample-020026,i have to find a man who knows that universal language
sample-020027,with the girl with the raven hair his days would never be the same again
sample-020028,the boy didn't want to talk about the pyramids
sample-020029,i dont mind working from home most of the time but i do miss having coworkers
sample-020030,this morning i found a calculator taped to my wii
sample-020031,it seemed so safe and tranquil
sample-020032,the englishman had been profoundly impressed by the story
sample-020033,his name is barry baldwin
sample-020034,the hand with the whip pointed to the south
sample-020035,i noticed that the boy answered
sample-020036,the boy didn't want to talk about the pyramids
sample-020037,the alchemist erased the circle in the sand and the snake slithered away among the rocks
sample-020038,hundreds must have seen it and taken it for a falling star
sample-020039,well it's a long list
sample-020040,his hands began to tremble and the woman sensed it
sample-020041,i went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the dark
sample-020042,the two men exchanged some words in arabic and the bar owner seemed irritated
sample-020043,wait until it happens to you sometime
sample-020044,the tribal chieftains will appreciate what you do
sample-020045,hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after
sample-020046,absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
sample-020047,don't you think i know where i live
sample-020050,if he ever decided to leave them they would suffer
sample-020051,that doesn't say much for mine
sample-020052,the boy accustomed to recognizing omens spoke to the merchant
sample-020053,the insurance was sky high
sample-020054,i heard a faint movement under my feet
sample-020055,about how wealthy would you say
sample-020056,doughnuts are best with strawberry sprinkles and coffee
sample-020057,the beer was more than just refreshing it was delicious
sample-020068,it almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted
sample-020069,they shouted consolation and promises and went off back to the town again to get help
sample-020078,maybe that's why they always stay close to me
sample-020079,it seemed such a little thing so bright and small and still
sample-020080,i am following my destiny
sample-020081,the alchemist knocked on the gate of the monastery
sample-020082,and so despite the fact that he was a roman centurion he converted to their faith
sample-020083,your son went to serve at a distant place and became a centurion
sample-020084,and that he a boy could perform miracles
sample-020085,something older than humanity more ancient than the desert
sample-020086,henderson was taking it in
sample-020087,then the old man began to inspect the sheep and he saw that one was lame
sample-020090,everybody quiet and ready for an emergency
sample-020091,and i'll sign a paper
sample-020092,its lower end was still embedded
sample-020093,i'm afraid it is important
sample-020094,they shouted consolation and promises and went off back to the town again to get help
sample-020095,my tax dollars pay for those public school proms
sample-020096,whenever he could he sought out a new road to travel
sample-020097,who you holding out on
sample-020108,i'll work for you he said
sample-020109,if what one finds is made of pure matter it will never spoil
sample-020118,it receded into the hole
sample-020119,my name is melchizedek said the old man
sample-020120,meanwhile the old man persisted in his attempt to strike up a conversation
sample-020121,the three fell silent
sample-020122,he's probably trying the gate
sample-020123,if you tell me why you came here i'll show you the project i've been working on
sample-020124,i'll be right back
sample-020125,if i had told you you wouldn't have seen the pyramids
sample-020126,they'll take care of it
sample-020127,when he emerged it was with a young arab dressed in white and gold
sample-020130,i have a warm feeling for my pair of dogwalkers
sample-020131,i was just going to
sample-020132,what do you mean by that
sample-020133,but he decided first to buy his bakery and put some money aside
sample-020134,the cover of the magazine showed a cute puppy
sample-020135,i myself heard nothing of that
sample-020136,just a memory right now it signified shade water and a refuge from the war
sample-020137,i'm at the end of my rope
sample-020140,there was very little talking
sample-020141,only when he himself reveals it
sample-020142,you've hinted it often enough
sample-020143,i had a dream and i met with a king
sample-020144,did you see uncle jake with any cash last night
sample-020145,the atmosphere was suffused with the sweet scent of smoke
sample-020146,but he decided first to buy his bakery and put some money aside
sample-020147,january was hot on the heels of december
sample-020148,when i returned to the common the sun was setting
sample-020149,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
sample-020150,what's done is done
sample-020151,even then he hardly understood what this meant
sample-020152,it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
sample-020153,what is love the desert asked
sample-020154,the boy promised himself that when he returned from egypt he would buy that sword
sample-020155,and he knew what was the fair price for every one of his animals
sample-020156,she used her microscope to inspect it
sample-020157,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
sample-020158,if he makes a buying mistake it doesn't affect him much
sample-020159,the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
sample-020160,suddenly the monster disappeared
sample-020161,don't try to move
sample-020163,the hydrogen gas escaped
sample-020164,they opened the bottle of wine and drank heavily
sample-020165,as they sat down at the only table in the place the crystal merchant laughed
sample-020166,how about some of that good spaghetti
sample-020167,didn't you read it
sample-020168,there's life here the boy said to the alchemist
sample-020169,it's a simple story
sample-020170,she doesn't have the money
sample-020171,i have already found my treasure
sample-020172,according to the calendar it was september
sample-020173,the englishman could not contain his excitement
sample-020174,from atop its walls one can catch a glimpse of africa
sample-020175,but before i go i want to tell you a little story
sample-020176,the new law was retroactive
sample-020177,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
sample-020178,an huge hole had been made by the impact of the projectile
sample-020179,i'm going to wait here for you every day
sample-020180,someone set fire to the trash
sample-020181,and he wasn't faring much better
sample-020182,they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
sample-020183,they are not really friends they just work together and talk from time to time
sample-020184,christopher was confused
sample-020185,you have told me about your dreams about the old king and your treasure
sample-020186,the boy recalled the brilliance he had noticed on the previous day
sample-020187,the night was warm and i was thirsty
sample-020188,the boy was surprised at his thoughts
sample-020190,it was a cobra whose venom could kill a person in minutes
sample-020191,that's not carson sphinx
sample-020192,here i am between my flock and my treasure the boy thought
sample-020193,i finally purchased a private jet
sample-020194,you're my daughter and i love you
sample-020195,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
sample-020196,is there a mrs joshua
sample-020197,and one or two persons were returning
sample-020198,think i'd better be going
sample-020199,they spoke about mercury salt dragons and kings and he didn't understand any of it
sample-020200,i don't know if i'll be able to find life in the desert the boy thought
sample-020201,he took urim and thummim from his pocket and began playing with them
sample-020202,i'm on the job
sample-020203,it was immediately apparent
sample-020204,the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees
sample-020205,it is i who dared to do so said the boy
sample-020206,the boy leapt as well but away from the alchemist
sample-020207,the boy noticed that the owner of the bar stood nearby listening attentively to their conversation
sample-020208,this is for the boy
sample-020209,sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
sample-020210,at once he connected the two incidents
sample-020211,he noticed the unequal cooling of its surface
sample-020212,wearing his new sandals he descended the stairs silently
sample-020213,she's going to lose her mind when she finds out
sample-020214,but you know that i'm not going to go to mecca
sample-020215,i didn't need to waste my time just for this he said
sample-020216,my laptop has crashed
sample-020217,is daddy in trouble
sample-020218,so what is salem like he asked trying to get some sort of clue
sample-020219,who'll keep the lamp in the window for you
sample-020220,its lower end was still embedded
sample-020221,they dismounted and the alchemist said nothing
sample-020222,two more months passed and the shelf brought many customers into the crystal shop
sample-020223,the man wept with happiness
sample-020224,the wind began to blow again
sample-020225,you left out number five
sample-020226,there were raised voicesand some sort of struggle appeared to be going on 
sample-020227,then you'll die in the midst of trying to realize your destiny
sample-020228,i won't shut up
sample-020229,love is the force that transforms and improves the soul of the world
sample-020230,the boy could certainly resist causing that kind of anxiety for the baker
sample-020231,why the shots stopped after the tenth no one on earth has tried to explain
sample-020232,the gods should not have desires because they don't have destinies
sample-020233,the boy was suddenly happy to be there at the warehouse
sample-020234,a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder
sample-020235,but he kept the sword in his hand
sample-020236,he was immensely excited at the news
sample-020237,suddenly he disappeared and i could hear a faint shriek behind the walls
sample-020238,he carried two dead hawks over his shoulder
sample-020239,i'm going to count three
sample-020240,i don't know you
sample-020241,not with my money
sample-020242,then one day the boy returned the books to the englishman
sample-020243,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
sample-020244,but he certainly didn't desire that an army invade the oasis
sample-020245,we need to solve this problem fast
sample-020246,i had to test your courage the stranger said
sample-020247,many people think computers will never have feelings
sample-020250,this is why alchemy exists the boy said
sample-020251,dense clouds of smoke or dust can be seen through a powerful telescope
sample-020252,he didn't want any conversation at this point
sample-020253,the meeting was over
sample-020254,strange images passed through my mind
sample-020255,he had seen the shooting star and was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere nearby
sample-020256,as he did so he talked with the monk about the tribal wars
sample-020257,finally as promised here is my code for jumping within a line
sample-020268,he put his headcloth in place and secured it with a ring made of camel skin
sample-020269,at the camp it was difficult to see anything
sample-020278,in retrospect everything was already decided when we heard the siren
sample-020279,maybe it was because they moved around so much
sample-020280,this puts me in a peculiar hole
sample-020281,advancing slowly they searched among the stones
sample-020282,but now the sounds inside had stopped
sample-020283,you can't believe it's not butter
sample-020284,let me talk to him
sample-020285,well i'd like to see their land and see how they live said his son
sample-020286,what am i doing
sample-020287,words can hurt very much
sample-020290,don't give in to your fears said the alchemist in a strangely gentle voice
sample-020291,what's she talking about
sample-020292,all the type  has been sent to salt lake
sample-020293,scattered groups of people were hurrying from the direction of woking
sample-020294,it was difficult not to think about what he had left behind
sample-020295,hash functions are oneway functions with a number of mathematical requirements
sample-020296,he won't quit his paper without giving notice after this
sample-020297,that's good thought the englishman
sample-020308,some people prefer not to quantify their feelings that way
sample-020309,treason is a blow that comes unexpectedly
sample-020318,so now i fear nothing because it was those omens that brought you to me
sample-020319,it's like the flight of those two hawks it can't be understood by reason alone
sample-020320,the young arab took out a book and began to read
sample-020321,the boy offered his bottle hoping that the old man would leave him alone
sample-020322,mr nelson come yet
sample-020323,three days from now he would be with the merchant's daughter
sample-020324,the city's lights were stunning to behold
sample-020325,well then why did you let me do it the boy asked
sample-020326,it was rising slowly and painfully out of the cylinder
sample-020327,they began to ride out over the sands with the moon lighting their way
sample-020330,i can see the billboards now
sample-020331,but as time passed tangier had changed
sample-020332,when the simum ceased to blow everyone looked to the place where the boy had been
sample-020333,at once he connected the two incidents
sample-020334,the city was still sleeping
sample-020335,i shall make us some ice cubes
sample-020336,that couldn't be one of the matthew boys
sample-020337,it's lucky you got away from her
sample-020340,i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
sample-020341,they wanted to save the oasis
sample-020342,let's meet tomorrow
sample-020343,but now i'm sad and alone
sample-020344,i'll be right back
sample-020345,he's mr big and mr small
sample-020346,communism is the opposite of capitalism
sample-020347,the scottish parliament contains politicians
sample-020348,my tax dollars pay for those public school proms
sample-020349,there has been a robbery at the burger shop in downtown
sample-020350,she didn't have one
sample-020351,at once he connected the two incidents
sample-020352,that sobered him a little
sample-020353,the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
sample-020354,people continued to come and go from the baker's shop
sample-020355,it had told him to dig where his tears fell
sample-020356,a man doesn't get in a situation like this every day
sample-020357,i thought about whether we should find coins and models in it and so on
sample-020358,i know it's soon to talk about it
sample-020359,but now the sounds inside had stopped
sample-020360,they walked together through the narrow streets of tangier
sample-020361,this man's going to jump off a roof
sample-020362,i have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk which was embedded in the ground
sample-020363,i can smell it
sample-020364,i beg your pardon
sample-020365,there's life here the boy said to the alchemist
sample-020366,the immense collection of people and animals began to travel faster
sample-020367,not always in this way but i always appear in one form or another
sample-020368,henderson went into the railway station to telegraph the news to london
sample-020369,the end of the cylinder was still as ogilvy and henderson had left it
sample-020370,and above all don't forget to follow your destiny through to its conclusion
sample-020371,this definitely works well
sample-020372,he was already re accustomed to desert's silence
sample-020373,toward the end of the afternoon they came upon a coptic monastery
sample-020374,doug's a good friend of mine
sample-020375,wait for the end of the war
sample-020376,let's stop this another commander said
sample-020377,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
sample-020378,once again he was experiencing the language without words
sample-020379,it should provided results comparable to the state of the art
sample-020380,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
sample-020381,he didn't know the man yet but his practiced eye would recognize him when he appeared
sample-020382,the merchants were assembling their stalls and the boy helped a candy seller to do his
sample-020383,of course the two were unable to do anything
sample-020384,there was no way for everybody to know about alchemy
sample-020385,i got it all ready
sample-020386,they were on the right track
sample-020387,that life may always have flavor
sample-020388,all the lawyers in the world aren't going to help you
sample-020389,the boy's name was santiago
sample-020390,while you're still champion
sample-020391,he had seen the shooting star and was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere nearby
sample-020392,a while ago i rode through the desert with a man who had books on alchemy
sample-020393,many people in berkshire surrey and middlesex must have seen it
sample-020394,let me comb your hair
sample-020395,the book was written in spanish
sample-020396,i have to separate out the sulfur
sample-020397,the sheep had taught him that
sample-020398,drink and enjoy yourself said the alchemist noticing that the boy was feeling happier
sample-020399,we were awaiting the guitar player to begin the concert
sample-020400,and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
sample-020401,she knows that men have to go away in order to return
sample-020402,that's not true the boy said
sample-020403,i thought that someday i'd be rich and could go to mecca
sample-020404,he walked slowly through the market
sample-020405,don't try and lick that pole your tongue will get stuck
sample-020406,almost everyone here speaks spanish
sample-020407,maybe this is an omen said the englishman half aloud
sample-020408,adam is a crook
sample-020409,always ask an objective question
sample-020410,the world speaks many languages the boy thought
sample-020411,and he asked the boy if he too were in search of the alchemist
sample-020412,the top of the cylinder was rotating on its body
sample-020413,whenever he saw the sea or a fire he fell silent impressed by their elemental force
sample-020414,something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top
sample-020415,the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
sample-020416,go ahead and have your dinner
sample-020417,i want to see the chieftains
sample-020418,witnesses report two armed suspects and four hostages
sample-020419,only when he himself reveals it
sample-020420,what do you need
sample-020421,i should have repeated it for him
sample-020422,i thought about whether we should find coins and models in it and so on
sample-020423,but men began to reject simple things and to write tracts interpretations and philosophical studies
sample-020424,all who went there were happy at having done so
sample-020425,then came the night of the first falling star
sample-020426,he was alarmed by what had happened
sample-020427,nope not going unless they have a giant inflatable slide
sample-020428,in any case the desert was impassable
sample-020429,he doesn't have anything else
sample-020430,the men of the desert were already familiar with that wind
sample-020431,i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit
sample-020432,but as he saw them lying there on the ground another phrase came to his mind
sample-020433,but i found it difficult to get to work because of the investigations
sample-020434,it drew a droplet of blood
sample-020435,they were surrounded by children curious to look at the animals and people that were arriving
sample-020436,strange images passed through my mind
sample-020437,as if i had the money back in a safe
sample-020438,then why are you doing it
sample-020439,you got fifty cents
sample-020440,tell them it's a case of serious delirium
sample-020441,don't forget that everything you deal with is only one thing and nothing else
sample-020442,well then why do we need all these books the boy asked
sample-020443,brenda peters just escaped from the county jail
sample-020444,i imagine this will be a surprise to some people
sample-020445,i've been trying to figure it out
sample-020446,people from all over the world have passed through this village son said his father
sample-020447,i've been looking for you all morning he said as he led the boy outside
sample-020450,almost everyone here speaks spanish
sample-020451,where do you come in
sample-020452,it was faintly marked with transverse stripes and slightly flattened from the perfect round
sample-020453,have you got a ring
sample-020454,the sunset faded into twilight before anything else happened
sample-020455,the boy swore that every time he heard the alarm he would heed its message
sample-020456,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
sample-020457,the river babbled inanely to itself
sample-020468,i tried to tell you right away but you started reminiscing
sample-020469,then suddenly he noticed it with a start
sample-020478,the newspaper articles had prepared everyone for the reception of the idea
sample-020479,i've been looking for you all morning he said as he led the boy outside
sample-020480,i'm not going to charge you anything now she said
sample-020481,the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
sample-020482,and one or two persons were returning
sample-020483,monkeys smile when they are scared
sample-020484,because life wants you to achieve your destiny
sample-020485,they were given to me as a present by a king the boy said
sample-020486,as they sat down at the only table in the place the crystal merchant laughed
sample-020487,the two men hurried back and found the cylinder still lying in the same position
sample-020490,he arose and taking up his crook began to awaken the sheep that still slept
sample-020491,then he realized that he had been distracted for a few moments looking at the sword
sample-020492,it was the first time either had touched the other
sample-020493,he must be disguised to avoid encounters with thieves
sample-020494,it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience
sample-020495,and don't forget the language of omens
sample-020496,she apparently didn't listen
sample-020497,i've done nothing of the sort
sample-020508,the city sealer's office
sample-020509,he's had sniffles all day
sample-020518,there was nothing to hold him back except himself
sample-020519,i'm working across on a cattle boat
sample-020520,you don't have to be rich skinny popular or even own a cape to perform a random act of kindness
sample-020521,the woman sat down and told him to be seated as well
sample-020522,my friend bought all the other sheep immediately
sample-020523,it seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of here
sample-020524,he had surprised himself with the thought
sample-020525,some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound
sample-020526,they set off running wildly into the trees
sample-020527,it spread through the planet's atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features
sample-020530,as students they founded an a capella group and now they're commercially successful
sample-020531,there's no danger the boy said when they had moved on past the encampment
sample-020532,maybe this is an omen said the englishman half aloud
sample-020533,you should evaluate it in a perceptual experiment
sample-020534,they mounted their horses and rode out in the direction of the pyramids of egypt
sample-020535,he had never even wept in front of his own sheep
sample-020536,and because the tribes declared war i went to the well seeking the alchemist
sample-020537,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
sample-020540,something older than humanity more ancient than the desert
sample-020541,if you start your emails with greetings let me be the first to welcome you to earth
sample-020542,that's true the boy thought
sample-020543,lindsey promised to call you from new york tonight
sample-020544,my mind ran on the possibilities of its content
sample-020545,he stood irresolute for a moment and then scrambled out of the pit
sample-020546,then he dropped his spade picked up his jacket and came out into the road
sample-020547,yes that's what love is
sample-020548,the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
sample-020549,i am in search of that universal language among other things
sample-020550,join the club
sample-020551,the guy thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to stop him
sample-020552,the cushion was soft and inviting
sample-020553,the alchemist probably already knew all that
sample-020554,they shouted consolation and promises and went off back to the town again to get help
sample-020555,the old man wore a breastplate of gold and he knew about my past
sample-020556,i told you to have the ice box fixed
sample-020557,i thought that someday i'd be rich and could go to mecca
sample-020558,before we begin with the actual baptism let's renew our creed
sample-020559,i got a continuance for a whole month
sample-020560,an alchemist said the alchemist
sample-020561,catherine walked alongside the canal
sample-020562,the guy thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to stop him
sample-020563,he waited patiently for the merchant to awaken and open the shop
sample-020564,the news was chilling to say the least
sample-020565,my hamster turned my homework into bedding
sample-020566,i had it served with my breakfast this morning
sample-020567,what's the matter with you
sample-020568,we've got to walk up to the tower
sample-020569,on the third day the chief met with his officers
sample-020570,she recounting in immense detail the mean things another girl had said to her
sample-020571,should i understand the emerald tablet the boy asked
sample-020572,the sun thought for a minute
sample-020573,and i told harry i thought i'd be bored to death
sample-020574,what did they have to eat
sample-020575,that's what alchemists do
sample-020576,you can't desert now
sample-020577,it's true that everything has its destiny but one day that destiny will be realized
sample-020578,but they were not there
sample-020579,wait until it happens to you sometime
sample-020580,if you start your emails with greetings let me be the first to welcome you to earth
sample-020581,on the third day the chief met with his officers
sample-020582,in some places the ground was covered with the salt of driedup lakes
sample-020583,so now i'm a camel driver
sample-020584,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
sample-020585,you've got the money
sample-020586,but he knew that salem wasn't in andalusia
sample-020587,the morning post just turned shelly eric over to the sheriff
sample-020588,he moved about invisible but everyone could hear him
sample-020589,what's for dinner tonight
sample-020590,i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit
sample-020591,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
sample-020592,ogilvy watched till one and then gave up
sample-020593,get me sophia back
sample-020594,if he ever decided to leave them they would suffer
sample-020595,of course the two were unable to do anything
sample-020596,he deleted five tables from the database
sample-020597,no that's not what i mean
sample-020598,the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
sample-020599,the sweet corn tasted better grilled
sample-020600,i suppose i could
sample-020601,did you ever walk into this office
sample-020602,we couldn't find the high street
sample-020603,i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
sample-020605,i'm an alchemist simply because i'm an alchemist he said as he prepared the meal
sample-020606,licorice is a black chewy food
sample-020607,and he asked the boy if he too were in search of the alchemist
sample-020608,and at that i told him and he took my place
sample-020609,the streamer of gas came out towards us
sample-020611,one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
sample-020612,how do i feel
sample-020613,i changed my mind
sample-020614,henderson went into the railway station to telegraph the news to london
sample-020615,i want you to help me turn myself into the wind the boy answered
sample-020616,i know very well what you're talking about
sample-020617,one by one the campfires were extinguished and the oasis fell as quiet as the desert
sample-020618,the top of the cylinder was rotating on its body
sample-020619,should i understand the emerald tablet the boy asked
sample-020620,he wanted to say so to the alchemist but he was afraid of the man
sample-020621,the robot was filled with wires and circuit boards
sample-020622,do you want to go to work for me the merchant asked
sample-020623,its lower end was still embedded
sample-020624,i was impatient to see it opened
sample-020625,she lives in the park
sample-020626,i'm going to guide you across the desert the alchemist said
sample-020627,if you pay attention to the present you can improve upon it
sample-020628,i've seen guys like you go under before
sample-020629,the canadian people are a little too humble
sample-020630,then suddenly he noticed it with a start
sample-020631,the airplane rose gracefully into the sky
sample-020632,when'd you see her last
sample-020633,he waited patiently for the merchant to awaken and open the shop
sample-020634,he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
sample-020635,i myself heard nothing of that
sample-020636,all the joy he had seen that morning had suddenly disappeared
sample-020637,i had it served with my breakfast this morning
sample-020639,and then they want the person to change
sample-020640,maybe we ought to go join her at the party
sample-020641,at once he connected the two incidents
sample-020642,my wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red green and yellow signal lights
sample-020643,for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
sample-020644,now his intuition was that he had been right in coming
sample-020645,you forgot to pack it
sample-020646,but now the sounds inside had stopped
sample-020647,there's nobody else on the paper who can write
sample-020650,and the odor of the animals became a bit more tolerable
sample-020651,the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
sample-020652,as soon as he saw me among the crowd he called to me to come down
sample-020653,it was something that i thought could happen only to others never to me
sample-020654,they tell their incredible stories at the time when you want to hear them
sample-020655,absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
sample-020656,there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
sample-020657,i'm addicted to recycling
sample-020668,but everything had changed
sample-020669,those are the rules of war the leader explained
sample-020678,he was more confident in himself though and felt as though he could conquer the world
sample-020679,much better said the old man
sample-020680,they're just a pile of stones
sample-020681,aunt tiffany and bank teller at the window
sample-020682,it was the old man who spoke first
sample-020683,he remembered the sword
sample-020684,will you trust him that he does it right
sample-020685,when i first reached through to it i thought the soul of the world was perfect
sample-020686,he understands the forces of nature
sample-020687,they're closing in on you
sample-020690,i've seen guys like you go under before
sample-020691,the boy spent a sleepless night
sample-020692,at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars
sample-020693,they become the soul o f the world
sample-020694,the monk laughed when he saw me come back in tatters
sample-020695,the dunes are changed by the wind but the desert never changes
sample-020696,i'm also going back to paris today
sample-020697,so immerse yourself in it
sample-020708,but he's on the right track
sample-020709,i'll show those guys
sample-020718,they were known as seers and they were held in fear by women and the elderly
sample-020719,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
sample-020720,that night there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet
sample-020721,i didn't say anything
sample-020722,it would be very useful if my web browser could synchronize all of its preferences not just some
sample-020723,maybe she didn't even remember him
sample-020724,the boy didn't know what to say
sample-020725,can't they see it's a frame up
sample-020726,i won't let you
sample-020727,you can't believe it's not butter
sample-020730,now leave us alone said the boy to the young arab
sample-020731,men have never understood the words of the wise
sample-020732,a line of flame high can be seen in the atmosphere
sample-020733,why there's oceans of room here
sample-020734,it seemed he had made the long journey for nothing
sample-020735,can i get a woot woot
sample-020736,they were looking only for gold his companion answered
sample-020737,he approached the mass and was surprised at the size and the shape
sample-020740,the end of the cylinder was still as ogilvy and henderson had left it
sample-020741,it's true life really is generous to those who pursue their destiny the boy thought
sample-020742,another trick the boy thought
sample-020743,the first baseman dropped the ball
sample-020744,what happened to your wings
sample-020745,whenever we wanted we could see him
sample-020746,for example instead of editing google maps consider contributing to openstreetmap
sample-020747,the two men hurried back and found the cylinder still lying in the same position
sample-020748,they forgot that lead copper and iron have their own destinies to fulfill
sample-020749,the same hand that had brandished the sword now held a whip
sample-020750,i'm not going very far the alchemist answered looking straight into the eyes of the horsemen
sample-020751,i've been trying to get her to come to
sample-020752,to show you one of life's simple lessons the alchemist answered
sample-020753,but that left me without any honest means of support
sample-020754,he told me i should try to do so
sample-020755,no he heard a voice on the wind say
sample-020756,i understand sheep they're no longer a problem and they can be good friends
sample-020757,hash functions are oneway functions with a number of mathematical requirements
sample-020758,the meeting was over
sample-020759,ten years at the university and here i am in a corral
sample-020760,i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit
sample-020761,dont share your opinions so readily because you never know who is listening
sample-020762,mine's in the door
sample-020763,the boy was surprised
sample-020764,i can't very well leave without a pair of water wings
sample-020765,it seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of here
sample-020766,he noticed the unequal cooling of its surface
sample-020767,my tax dollars pay for those public school proms
sample-020768,but everything had changed
sample-020769,help me the boy said
sample-020770,you don't have to be rich skinny popular or even own a cape to perform a random act of kindness
sample-020771,ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
sample-020772,i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit
sample-020773,but now the sounds inside had stopped
sample-020774,improving the public transport system would help avoid traffic jams
sample-020775,i'm not afraid of failing
sample-020776,your money saved us for three days
sample-020777,it seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of here
sample-020778,i'm trying to explain to my mother how to get pictures off her phone
sample-020779,the sun thought for a minute
sample-020780,i'll talk to you tonight
sample-020781,one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
sample-020782,i didn't mean to shoot him
sample-020783,the three fell silent
sample-020784,it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-020785,i have the money i need to buy my sheep
sample-020786,this morning i found a calculator taped to my wii
sample-020787,i have been waiting for you here at this oasis for a long time
sample-020788,that he had attended a seminary until he was sixteen
sample-020789,but i found it difficult to get to work because of the investigations
sample-020790,throughout the night the boy dug at the place he had chosen but found nothing
sample-020791,but those who know about such things would know that those are urim and thummim
sample-020792,everyone has his or her own way of learning things he said to himself
sample-020793,he arose and taking up his crook began to awaken the sheep that still slept
sample-020794,it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
sample-020795,the boy climbed the dune slowly
sample-020796,suddenly a huge quantity of green smoke came out of the pit in three puffs and went straight into the still air
sample-020797,let's fly to the stars together he suggested
sample-020798,i'm trying to explain to my mother how to get pictures off her phone
sample-020799,i want to live again
sample-020800,he told fatima that at their next meeting
sample-020801,with a bag of marshmallows
sample-020802,then i don't get paid
sample-020803,the heat lasted until nightfall and all that time he had to carry his jacket
sample-020804,looking through the telescope i saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet
sample-020805,those are the rules of war the leader explained
sample-020806,he had understood the story the old king had told him
sample-020807,the streamer of gas came out towards us
sample-020808,at once he connected the two incidents
sample-020809,any statement on the red uprising tomorrow
sample-020810,they're just a pile of stones
sample-020811,what's the idea of locking this
sample-020812,henderson went into the railway station to telegraph the news to london
sample-020813,not everyone can see his dreams come true in the same way
sample-020814,i'd like you to take me there if you can
sample-020815,it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
sample-020816,the boy had met the alchemist
sample-020817,you've got everything all set
sample-020818,you should see the other guy specifically how good at fighting he is
sample-020819,you can count on me under one condition
sample-020820,i shall make us some ice cubes
sample-020821,he carried two dead hawks over his shoulder
sample-020822,used to hunt rabbits there myself
sample-020824,there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
sample-020825,the boy swore that every time he heard the alarm he would heed its message
sample-020826,i'm never more aware of a room's acoustics than when i'm trying to enjoy a snack i have no intention of sharing
sample-020827,the tea seemed less bitter
sample-020828,i was impatient to see it opened
sample-020829,it was immediately apparent
sample-020830,we've got something a whole lot bigger than that
sample-020831,ask the owner of that stall how much the sword costs he said to his friend
sample-020832,the closer he got to the realization of his dream the more difficult things became
sample-020833,the boy became fearful the omens told him that something was wrong
sample-020834,it was the time of day when all of spain slept during the summer
sample-020835,think i'll go home and see what the family is doing
sample-020836,enemy spotted
sample-020838,it was faintly marked with transverse stripes and slightly flattened from the perfect round
sample-020839,but one of them seized the boy and yanked him back out of the hole
sample-020848,people saw me coming and welcomed me he thought
sample-020849,i'm trying to explain to my mother how to get pictures off her phone
sample-020858,who is this man
sample-020859,he listened to the wind and felt the stones beneath his feet
sample-020860,my mind ran on the possibilities of its content
sample-020861,the top had certainly ceased to rotate
sample-020862,he got up early with the idea of finding it
sample-020863,there were raised voicesand some sort of struggle appeared to be going on 
sample-020864,this desert was once a sea he said
sample-020865,the data from figures  and  should be represented much better
sample-020866,we lit the lantern and walked over to his house
sample-020867,venus is far too hot for exploration
sample-020870,well why don't you go to mecca now asked the boy
sample-020871,the englishman prodded him and the boy asked her about the man who cured people's illnesses
sample-020872,it's the master work of the alchemists
sample-020873,and i'd like to have it
sample-020874,he stuck his hand into the pouch and felt around for one of the stones
sample-020875,something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top
sample-020876,about eleven i walked back to my home in maybury because nothing seemed to be happening
sample-020877,why do they need gin
sample-020888,he decided to stay right there and await his return
sample-020889,one afternoon one of his servants fell ill and it appeared that he would die
sample-020898,the boy had met the alchemist
sample-020899,there were raised voicesand some sort of struggle appeared to be going on 
sample-020900,i only interpret dreams
sample-020901,the salesman was like the rest of them untrustworthy
sample-020902,strange images passed through my mind
sample-020903,the crowd swayed a little as i elbowed my way through
sample-020904,and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
sample-020905,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
sample-020906,it's the master work of the alchemists
sample-020907,she loves to read but is unsure how reading is helping her become more creative
sample-020910,she was the one in charge of everything
sample-020911,given only the public key it is very hard to compute the private one
sample-020912,you should see the other guy specifically how good at fighting he is
sample-020913,i sold crystal and crossed the desert
sample-020914,she was beautiful from behind but he couldn't see her face yet
sample-020915,the text is often unnecessarily obscure
sample-020916,people say strange things the boy thought
sample-020917,in those days very few of the people had any idea about astronomy
sample-020928,just give me a few hours before you make any decisions
sample-020929,they were relieved and happy
sample-020938,but as time passed tangier had changed
sample-020939,i need you to be spontaneous he asked me out to din din
sample-020940,i just don't trust anyone who says they've never had hamburger helper
sample-020941,i waited all afternoon and evening he said
sample-020942,the text implies that method handles scaling rotation and translation
sample-020943,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
sample-020944,an huge hole had been made by the impact of the projectile
sample-020945,and he knew what was the fair price for every one of his animals
sample-020946,and they attacked an empty tent
sample-020947,but before i go i want to tell you a little story
sample-020948,i only interpret dreams
sample-020949,curse the moment i met that old man he thought
sample-020950,they blow across the world without a birthplace and with no place to die
sample-020951,he said he had never seen any like them
sample-020952,the old woman had said the same thing
sample-020953,are there any other questions
sample-020954,i can't get hold of him
sample-020955,the old man wore a breastplate of heavy gold covered with precious stones
sample-020956,he decided to stay right there and await his return
sample-020957,its lower end was still embedded
sample-020958,today i understand something i didn't see before every blessing ignored becomes a curse
sample-020959,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
sample-020960,the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
sample-020961,let's the alchemist answered
sample-020962,the boy didn't know what to say
sample-020963,the boy thanked him ate it and went on his way
sample-020964,he noticed the unequal cooling of its surface
sample-020965,because you'll know its dreams and wishes and will know how to deal with them
sample-020966,it brought his heart into his mouth
sample-020967,and i'll sign a paper
sample-020968,he placed urim and thummim in the chest
sample-020969,he told them all to be seated
sample-020970,sit down and let me treat you to something said the boy
sample-020971,do not do tomorrow what you could do today
sample-020972,you know what we're going to do
sample-020973,my calendar was full that month
sample-020974,love is the force that transforms and improves the soul of the world
sample-020975,he expertly gutted the rabbit
sample-020976,she said linda did it
sample-020977,he told me i should try to do so
sample-020978,but the boy couldn't even speak
sample-020979,he saw that fatima's eyes were filled with tears
sample-020980,i left my father my mother and the town castle behind
sample-020981,it was only when i got this close to it that the strangeness of it was at all evident to me
sample-020982,the alchemist stopped abruptly and bent to the ground
sample-020983,he paused and his eyes were still unfriendly
sample-020984,i know its dimensions and how it behaves
sample-020985,another who was searching the boy's bags found the piece of gold
sample-020986,an alchemist said the alchemist
sample-020987,don't give in to your fears said the alchemist in a strangely gentle voice
sample-020988,the top of the cylinder was rotating on its body
sample-020989,there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
sample-020990,one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
sample-020991,the boy was strong and wanted to retaliate but he was in a foreign country
sample-020992,and ask for a glass of wine for me
sample-020993,we always observe the tradition
sample-020994,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
sample-020995,the boy looked around for the ovens and other apparatus used in alchemy but saw none
sample-020996,might as well be living in a refrigerator
sample-020997,how do you feel
sample-020998,his heart squeezed as if his chest had suddenly compressed it
sample-020999,i wish i was up there with them
sample-021000,now go eat your dinner
sample-021001,the following night the boy appeared at the alchemist's tent with a horse
